# World English Scripture

Online at [jesusbible.github.io](https://jesusbible.github.io)

A revision of the 2023 World English Bible, which is based on the 1901 ASV, which is based on the 1611 KJV, much of which is based on the 1530 Tyndale version, which is based on the Greek 1516 Textus Receptus and the Hebrew 1008 A.D. Masoretic Text.

In the few revisions made, this version tends to favor the Hebrew 1380 Shem Tov manuscript and Syriac manuscripts for the New Testament, especially due to their lack of Roman and Greek influence. Conversely, the Genesis chronology restoration is based primarily on the Greek Septuagint in order to make up for deficiencies in the Hebrew Masoretic Text.

The following is a brief outline to answer the following questions:
- **WHAT** has been revised?
- And **WHY** has it been revised?

---

1. Book Selection: Based on Yahweh and Yeshua  
Yahweh instructs us to listen to his son, the Messiah, Yeshua (Matthew 17:5).
Yeshua is reliably quoted in Matthew, John, and Revelation. He cites the Law and Prophets (Matthew 5:17-19). He also quotes Psalms, and Yahweh is quoted in Psalm 2. In Ezekiel, Yahweh mentions Job twice, and Yahweh is quoted in the book of Job. Any text presented here must pass the test of Deuteronomy 13. The focus of the collection presented is the sayings of Yahweh and Yeshua.

**SPECIFIC EDITS**  
The following edits pertain only to specific verses

2. Restore Genesis Chronology according to Henry B. Smith Jr.'s 2018 proposal  
Scribes corrupted the Masoretic Text, but we can restore it.

3. Translate "בעל" as "owner", not "husband", except for nouns and idioms  
The adjective "בעל" means owner, or master. "Husband" is a poor translation.

4. Remove Roman/Greek Trinity and Virgin Birth bias  
They're Anti-Torah, and bias is not true to the text.

5. Restore 'do not swear' to  'do not swear falsely'  
The Shem Tov provides a Torah-compatible rendering.

6. Omit possible additions to Yeshua's prayer  
Prefer the Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies reading over tradition.

7. Omit unlikely verse Matthew 17:21  
This verse may have been inserted to support asceticism. Prefer the Syriac manuscripts and Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies reading.

8. Omit unlikely verse Matthew 18:11  
Prefer the Syriac manuscripts and Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies reading.

9. Clarify the word "divorce" to "put away" when applicable  
Prefer a Torah-compatible translation found in The Scriptures 1998 by Institute for Scripture Research, and other translations including the KJV.

10. Matthew 26:64 restore "Power" to "Yahweh"  
It seems more likely than not that Yeshua spoke Yahweh's name, especially given that he says he makes the heavenly father's name known, and in understanding the context of the passage, especially in contrast with the Septuagint translation of Leviticus 24:16. The Scriptures 1998 by ISR restores his name very liberally. Of all places to restore it, this seems most justified. The reaction Yeshua experienced doesn't really make sense unless he spoke Yahweh's name.


**BULK EDITS**  
The following edits occur throughout all books

11. Restore title "God" to "Elohim"  
Avoid using a questionable word. Transliterate instead.

12. Restore word "Holy" to "Set-Apart"  
Avoid a questionable word, and improve translation clarity.

13. Translate "איש" as man, not husband, and "אישה" as woman, not wife  
Husband/wife are terms foreign to Hebrew and Greek that may add confusion.

14. Restore name "Jesus" to "Yeshua"  
Restore name to more accurate transliteration.

15. Restore phrase "became the father of" to "brought forth"  
Avoid the phrase "became the father of", which is poor translation, and has doctrinal issues, and instead use a literal translation.


**PRESENTATION**  
The intended presentation, online or in print

16. Chapter and verse numbers are omitted by default  
Except for Psalms, numerical divisions are not scripture, and they obstruct the text.

17. Footnotes are omitted by default  
Translation notes and cross-references are unnecessary and distracting.
