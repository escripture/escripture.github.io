A revision of the 2023 World English Bible, which is based on the 1901 ASV, which is based on the 1611 KJV, much of which is based on the 1530 Tyndale version, which is based on the Greek 1516 Textus Receptus and the Hebrew 1008 A.D. Masoretic Text.

In the few revisions made, this version tends to favor the Hebrew 1380 Shem Tov manuscript and Syriac manuscripts for Matthew, because of their independence from Roman and Greek influence. Conversely, the Genesis chronology restoration is based primarily on the Greek Septuagint in order to make up for deficiencies in the Hebrew Masoretic Text.

The following is a brief outline to answer the following questions:
- **WHAT** has been revised?
- And **WHY** has it been revised?

---

1. Base book selection on Yahuah and Yahushua.  
Yahuah instructs us to listen to his son, the Messiah, Yahushua (Matthew 17:5).
Yahushua is reliably quoted in Matthew. He cites the Law and Prophets (Matthew 5:17-19). He also quotes Psalms, and Yahuah is quoted in Psalm 2. In Ezekiel, Yahuah mentions Job twice, and Yahuah is quoted in the book of Job. Any text presented here must pass the test of Deuteronomy 13. The focus of the collection presented is the sayings of Yahuah and Yahushua.

**SPECIFIC EDITS**  
These edits pertain only to specific verses.

2. Restore Genesis chronology according to Henry B. Smith Jr.'s 2018 proposal.  
Scribes corrupted the Masoretic Text, but we can restore it.

3. Translate "בעל" as "owner", not "husband", except for nouns and idioms.  
The adjective "בעל" means owner, or master. "Husband" is a poor translation.

4. Remove Roman/Greek Trinity and Virgin Birth bias.  
They're Anti-Torah, and bias is not true to the text.

5. Restore 'do not swear' to  'do not swear falsely'.  
The Shem Tov provides a Torah-compatible rendering.

6. Omit possible additions to Yahushua's prayer.  
Prefer the Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies reading over tradition.

7. Omit unlikely verse Matthew 17:21.  
This verse may have been inserted to support asceticism. Prefer the Syriac manuscripts and Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies reading.

8. Omit unlikely verse Matthew 18:11.  
Prefer the Syriac manuscripts and Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies reading.

9. Clarify the word "divorce" to "put away" when applicable.  
Prefer a Torah-compatible translation found in The Scriptures 1998 by Institute for Scripture Research, and other translations including the KJV.

10. Restore "Power" to "Yahuah" in Matthew 26:64.  
It seems more likely than not that Yahushua spoke Yahuah's name, especially given that he says he makes the heavenly father's name known, and in understanding the context of the passage, especially in contrast with the Septuagint translation of Leviticus 24:16. The Scriptures 1998 by ISR restores his name very liberally. Of all places to restore it, this seems most justified. The reaction Yahushua experienced doesn't really make sense unless he spoke Yahuah's name.


**BULK EDITS**  
These edits apply to words and phrases throughout all books.

11. Restore title "God" to "Elohim".  
Avoid using a questionable word. Transliterate instead.

12. Restore word "Holy" to "Set-Apart".  
Avoid a questionable word, and improve translation clarity.

13. Translate "איש" as man, not husband, and "אישה" as woman, not wife.  
Husband/wife are terms foreign to Hebrew and Greek that may add confusion.

14. Restore name "Jesus" to "Yahushua".  
Restore name to more accurate transliteration.

15. Restore phrase "became the father of" to "brought forth".  
Avoid the phrase "became the father of", which is poor translation, and has doctrinal issues, and instead use a literal translation.


**PRESENTATION**  
These edits affect the formatting, online or in print.

16. Omit chapter and verse numbers.  
Except for Psalms, numerical divisions are not scripture, and they obstruct the text.

17. Omit footnotes.  
Translation notes and cross-references are unnecessary and distracting.

18. Disable red lettering.  
Red lettering adds biased opinion. It is not a characteristic of the manuscripts.
