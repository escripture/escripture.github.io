The goal of this site is to present scriptures for reading.

The World English Bible, Protestant edition, has been revised with the following main objectives in mind:
- The text should be presented in a readable manner
- Only texts which are trustworthy should be presented
- Corrections should be made when necessary

The complete revision process is in the setup.sh file.
