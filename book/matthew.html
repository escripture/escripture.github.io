<sup>1&#160;</sup>The book of the genealogy of Yahushua Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Abraham brought forth Isaac. Isaac brought forth Jacob. Jacob brought forth Judah and his brothers. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Judah brought forth Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez brought forth Hezron. Hezron brought forth Ram. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Ram brought forth Amminadab. Amminadab brought forth Nahshon. Nahshon brought forth Salmon. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Salmon brought forth Boaz by Rahab. Boaz brought forth Obed by Ruth. Obed brought forth Jesse. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Jesse brought forth King David. David the king brought forth Solomon by her who had been Uriah’s woman. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Solomon brought forth Rehoboam. Rehoboam brought forth Abijah. Abijah brought forth Asa. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Asa brought forth Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat brought forth Joram. Joram brought forth Uzziah. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Uzziah brought forth Jotham. Jotham brought forth Ahaz. Ahaz brought forth Hezekiah. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Hezekiah brought forth Manasseh. Manasseh brought forth Amon. Amon brought forth Josiah. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Josiah brought forth Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah brought forth Shealtiel. Shealtiel brought forth Zerubbabel. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Zerubbabel brought forth Abiud. Abiud brought forth Eliakim. Eliakim brought forth Azor. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Azor brought forth Zadok. Zadok brought forth Achim. Achim brought forth Eliud. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Eliud brought forth Eleazar. Eleazar brought forth Matthan. Matthan brought forth Jacob. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Jacob brought forth Joseph. This Joseph brought forth Yahushua, who is called Christ. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations. 
 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now when Yahushua was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah, 
</div><div class="q2">are in no way least among the princes of Judah; 
</div><div class="q1">for out of you shall come a governor 
</div><div class="q2">who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>He arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“A voice was heard in Ramah, 
</div><div class="q2">lamentation, weeping and great mourning, 
</div><div class="q1">Rachel weeping for her children; 
</div><div class="q2">she wouldn’t be comforted, 
</div><div class="q2">because they are no more.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee, 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets that he will be called a Nazarene. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!” 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">“The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
</div><div class="q2">make the way of the Lord ready! 
</div><div class="q2">Make his paths straight!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that Elohim is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Set-Apart Spirit. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>But Yahushua, answering, said to him, <span class="wj">“Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.”</span> Then he allowed him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Yahushua, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of Elohim descending as a dove, and coming on him. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Today I have become his father.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of Elohim, command that these stones become bread.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>But he answered, <span class="wj">“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of Elohim’s mouth.’&#160;”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then the devil took him into the set-apart city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>and said to him, “If you are the Son of Elohim, throw yourself down, for it is written, 
</div><div class="q1">‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and, 
</div><div class="q1">‘On their hands they will bear you up, 
</div><div class="q2">so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your Elohim.’&#160;”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“Get behind me,</span> <span class="wj">Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your Elohim, and you shall serve him only.’&#160;”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Now when Yahushua heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, 
</div><div class="q2">toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, 
</div><div class="q2">Galilee of the Gentiles, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>the people who sat in darkness saw a great light; 
</div><div class="q2">to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, 
</div><div class="q2">to them light has dawned.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>From that time, Yahushua began to preach, and to say, <span class="wj">“Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They immediately left their nets and followed him. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Yahushua went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Blessed are the poor in spirit,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed are those who mourn,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for they shall be comforted.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed are the gentle,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for they shall inherit the earth.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, </span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for they shall be filled.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed are the merciful,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for they shall obtain mercy.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed are the pure in heart,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for they shall see Elohim.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed are the peacemakers,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for they shall be called children of Elohim.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, </span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. </span> 
<sup>12&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup><span class="wj">You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. </span> 
<sup>15&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. </span> 
<sup>16&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Even so, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. </span> 
<sup>18&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter</span> <span class="wj">shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. </span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. </span> 
<sup>20&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’</span> <span class="wj">and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ </span> 
<sup>22&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, </span> 
<sup>24&#160;</sup><span class="wj">leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. </span> 
<sup>25&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. </span> 
<sup>26&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“You have heard that it was said, </span> <span class="wj">‘You shall not commit adultery;’</span> 
<sup>28&#160;</sup><span class="wj">but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. </span> 
<sup>29&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.</span> 
<sup>30&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>31&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“It was also said, ‘Whoever shall put away his woman, let him give her a writing of divorce,’</span> 
<sup>32&#160;</sup><span class="wj">but I tell you that whoever puts away his woman, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>33&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Again you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not make false vows by my name, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,’</span> 
<sup>34&#160;</sup><span class="wj">but I tell you, don’t swear falsely at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of Elohim; </span> 
<sup>35&#160;</sup><span class="wj">nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. </span> 
<sup>36&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can’t make one hair white or black. </span> 
<sup>37&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>38&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’</span> 
<sup>39&#160;</sup><span class="wj">And I say to you not to pay evil in exchange for evil, but if hit on your right cheek, prepare for a hit to your left! </span> 
<sup>40&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. </span> 
<sup>41&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. </span> 
<sup>42&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>43&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor </span> <span class="wj">and hate your enemy.’</span> 
<sup>44&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, </span> 
<sup>45&#160;</sup><span class="wj">that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. </span> 
<sup>46&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? </span> 
<sup>47&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors</span> <span class="wj">do the same? </span> 
<sup>48&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.</span> 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Be careful that you don’t do your charitable giving</span> <span class="wj">before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. </span> 
<sup>2&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Therefore, when you do merciful deeds, don’t sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward. </span> 
<sup>3&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does, </span> 
<sup>4&#160;</sup><span class="wj">so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward. </span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. </span> 
<sup>7&#160;</sup><span class="wj">In praying, don’t use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. </span> 
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Therefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him. </span> 
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Pray like this: </span> 
</div><div class="q1"><span class="wj">“&#160;‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept set-apart. </span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Let your Kingdom come. </span>

<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahushua stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <span class="wj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help,

</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“I will come and heal him.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>When Yahushua heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. </span> 
<sup>11&#160;</sup><span class="wj">I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, </span>

<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to the centurion, <span class="wj">“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>When Yahushua came into Peter’s house, he saw his woman’s mother lying sick with a fever. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He touched her hand, and the fever left her. So she got up and served him. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Now when Yahushua saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>A scribe came and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>But Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves; but he was asleep. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” </span> Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Yahushua, Son of Elohim? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Go!”</span> 
</div><div class="p">They came out and went into the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Behold, all the city came out to meet Yahushua. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="9">9</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>He entered into a boat and crossed over, and came into his own city. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Yahushua, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, <span class="wj">“Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahushua, knowing their thoughts, said, <span class="wj">“Why do you think evil in your hearts? </span> 
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk’? </span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—”</span> (then he said to the paralytic), <span class="wj">“Get up, and take up your mat, and go to your house.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>He arose and departed to his house. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified Elohim, who had given such authority to men. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>As Yahushua passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, <span class="wj">“Follow me.”</span> He got up and followed him. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>As he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Yahushua and his disciples. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>When Yahushua heard it, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. </span> 
<sup>13&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But you go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span> <span class="wj">for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then John’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. </span> 
<sup>16&#160;</sup><span class="wj">No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made. </span>

</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yahushua got up and followed him, as did his disciples. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Behold, a woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>But Yahushua, turning around and seeing her, said, <span class="wj">“Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.”</span> And the woman was made well from that hour. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>When Yahushua came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder, 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>he said to them, <span class="wj">“Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">They were ridiculing him. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>But when the crowd was sent out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>The report of this went out into all that land. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>As Yahushua passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David!” 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</span> 
</div><div class="p">They told him, “Yes, Lord.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Then he touched their eyes, saying, <span class="wj">“According to your faith be it done to you.”</span> 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Then their eyes were opened. Yahushua strictly commanded them, saying, <span class="wj">“See that no one knows about this.”</span> 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>35&#160;</sup>Yahushua went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>Then he said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few. </span>

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>When Yahushua had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and said to him, “Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahushua answered them, <span class="wj">“Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: </span> 
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,</span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>As these went their way, Yahushua began to say to the multitudes concerning John, <span class="wj">“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? </span> 
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses. </span> 
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. </span> 
<sup>10&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For this is he, of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’</span> 
<sup>11&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he. </span> 
<sup>12&#160;</sup><span class="wj">From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> 
<sup>13&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. </span> 
<sup>14&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come. </span> 
<sup>15&#160;</sup><span class="wj">He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions </span> 
<sup>17&#160;</sup><span class="wj">and say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’ </span> 
<sup>18&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ </span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didn’t repent. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. </span> 
<sup>22&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. </span> 
<sup>23&#160;</sup><span class="wj">You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to Hades. </span> <span class="wj">For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until today. </span> 
<sup>24&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment, than for you.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>At that time, Yahushua answered, <span class="wj">“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants. </span> 
<sup>26&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight. </span> 
<sup>27&#160;</sup><span class="wj">All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does anyone know the Father, except the Son and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>28&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest. </span> 
<sup>29&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls. </span> 
<sup>30&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</span> 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="12">12</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>At that time, Yahushua went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>But he said to them, <span class="wj">“Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: </span> 
<sup>4&#160;</sup><span class="wj">how he entered into Elohim’s house and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span> 
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? </span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. </span> 
<sup>7&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span> <span class="wj">you wouldn’t have condemned the guiltless. </span> 
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>He departed from there and went into their synagogue. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?” so that they might accuse him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it and lift it out? </span> 
<sup>12&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.”</span> 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then he told the man, <span class="wj">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how they might destroy him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Yahushua, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>and commanded them that they should not make him known, 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, 
</div><div class="q2">my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. 
</div><div class="q1">I will put my Spirit on him. 
</div><div class="q2">He will proclaim justice to the nations. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>He will not strive, nor shout, 
</div><div class="q2">neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He won’t break a bruised reed. 
</div><div class="q2">He won’t quench a smoking flax, 
</div><div class="q1">until he leads justice to victory. 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>In his name, the nations will hope.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him; and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>All the multitudes were amazed, and said, “Can this be the son of David?” 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Knowing their thoughts, Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. </span> 
<sup>26&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? </span> 
<sup>27&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. </span> 
<sup>28&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But if I by the Spirit of Elohim cast out demons, then Elohim’s Kingdom has come upon you. </span> 
<sup>29&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>30&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn’t gather with me, scatters. </span> 
<sup>31&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men. </span> 
<sup>32&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Set-Apart Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age, or in that which is to come.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>33&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit. </span> 
<sup>34&#160;</sup><span class="wj">You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. </span> 
<sup>35&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The good man out of his good treasure</span> <span class="wj">brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things. </span> 
<sup>36&#160;</sup><span class="wj">I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. </span> 
<sup>37&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>38&#160;</sup>Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>39&#160;</sup>But he answered them, <span class="wj">“An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet. </span> 
<sup>40&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </span> 
<sup>41&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here. </span> 
<sup>42&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here. </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>43&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“When an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest, and doesn’t find it. </span> 
<sup>44&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Then he says, ‘I will return into my house from which I came;’ and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. </span> 
<sup>45&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>46&#160;</sup>While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him. 
<sup>47&#160;</sup>One said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>48&#160;</sup>But he answered him who spoke to him, <span class="wj">“Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”</span> 
<sup>49&#160;</sup>He stretched out his hand toward his disciples, and said, <span class="wj">“Behold, my mother and my brothers! </span> 
<sup>50&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.”</span> 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="13">13</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>On that day Yahushua went out of the house and sat by the seaside. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, <span class="wj">“Behold, a farmer went out to sow. </span> 
<sup>4&#160;</sup><span class="wj">As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them. </span> 
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth. </span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away. </span> 
<sup>7&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them. </span> 
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Others fell on good soil and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. </span> 
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>He answered them, <span class="wj">“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them. </span> 
<sup>12&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he has. </span> 
<sup>13&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear, neither do they understand. </span> 
<sup>14&#160;</sup><span class="wj">In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, </span> 
</div><div class="q1"><span class="wj">‘By hearing you will hear,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">and will in no way understand;</span> 
</div><div class="q1"><span class="wj">Seeing you will see,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">and will in no way perceive;</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup><span class="wj">for this people’s heart has grown callous,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">their ears are dull of hearing,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">and they have closed their eyes;</span> 
</div><div class="q1"><span class="wj">or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,</span>

</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">understand with their heart,</span> 
</div><div class="q1"><span class="wj">and would turn again,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">and I would heal them.’</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. </span> 
<sup>17&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer. </span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside. </span> 
<sup>20&#160;</sup><span class="wj">What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately with joy receives it; </span> 
<sup>21&#160;</sup><span class="wj">yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles. </span> 
<sup>22&#160;</sup><span class="wj">What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. </span> 
<sup>23&#160;</sup><span class="wj">What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="wj">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, </span> 
<sup>25&#160;</sup><span class="wj">but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds</span> <span class="wj">also among the wheat, and went away. </span> 
<sup>26&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But when the blade sprang up and produced grain, then the darnel weeds appeared also. </span> 
<sup>27&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?’</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>28&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’</span> 
</div><div class="p"><span class="wj">“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’ </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them. </span> 
<sup>30&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”&#160;’&#160;”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="wj">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took, and sowed in his field, </span> 
<sup>32&#160;</sup><span class="wj">which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>He spoke another parable to them. <span class="wj">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures</span> <span class="wj">of meal, until it was all leavened.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Yahushua spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them, 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">“I will open my mouth in parables; 
</div><div class="q2">I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>37&#160;</sup>He answered them, <span class="wj">“He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, </span> 
<sup>38&#160;</sup><span class="wj">the field is the world, the good seeds are the children of the Kingdom, and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one. </span> 
<sup>39&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. </span> 
<sup>40&#160;</sup><span class="wj">As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age. </span> 
<sup>41&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those who do iniquity, </span> 
<sup>42&#160;</sup><span class="wj">and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span> 
<sup>43&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>44&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>45&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, </span> 
<sup>46&#160;</sup><span class="wj">who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>47&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind, </span> 
<sup>48&#160;</sup><span class="wj">which, when it was filled, fishermen drew up on the beach. They sat down and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away. </span> 
<sup>49&#160;</sup><span class="wj">So it will be in the end of the world.</span> <span class="wj">The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous, </span> 
<sup>50&#160;</sup><span class="wj">and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span> 
<sup>51&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“Have you understood all these things?” </span> 
</div><div class="p">They answered him, “Yes, Lord.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>52&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>53&#160;</sup>When Yahushua had finished these parables, he departed from there. 
<sup>54&#160;</sup>Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? 
<sup>55&#160;</sup>Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? 
<sup>56&#160;</sup>Aren’t all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?” 
<sup>57&#160;</sup>They were offended by him. 
</div><div class="p">But Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.”</span> 
<sup>58&#160;</sup>He didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="14">14</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Yahushua, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.” 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s woman. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,

<sup>11&#160;</sup>His head was brought on a platter and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>His disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Yahushua. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Now when Yahushua heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yahushua went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.

<sup>16&#160;</sup>But Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span>

<sup>17&#160;</sup>They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>He said, <span class="wj">“Bring them here to me.”</span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They all ate and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Immediately Yahushua made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>In the fourth watch of the night, Yahushua came to them, walking on the sea. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>But immediately Yahushua spoke to them, saying, <span class="wj">“Cheer up! It is I! </span> <span class="wj">Don’t be afraid.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>He said, <span class="wj">“Come!”</span> 
</div><div class="p">Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the waters to come to Yahushua. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Immediately Yahushua stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, <span class="wj">“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”</span> 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the Son of Elohim!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick; 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="15">15</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then Pharisees and scribes came to Yahushua from Jerusalem, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He answered them, <span class="wj">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of Elohim because of your tradition? </span> 
<sup>4&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For Elohim commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span> 
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to Elohim,” </span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of Elohim void because of your tradition. </span> 
<sup>7&#160;</sup><span class="wj">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">and honor me with their lips;</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">but their heart is far from me.</span> 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">And they worship me in vain,</span> 
</div><div class="q2"><span class="wj">teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’&#160;”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Hear, and understand. </span> 
<sup>11&#160;</sup><span class="wj">That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>But he answered, <span class="wj">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span> 
<sup>14&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>So Yahushua said, <span class="wj">“Do you also still not understand? </span> 
<sup>17&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body? </span> 
<sup>18&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. </span> 
<sup>20&#160;</sup><span class="wj">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yahushua went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>But he answered her not a word. 
</div><div class="p">His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>But he answered, <span class="wj">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>But he answered, <span class="wj">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua answered her, <span class="wj">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Yahushua departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the Elohim of Israel. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Yahushua summoned his disciples and said, <span class="wj">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.” </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“How many loaves do you have?”</span> 
</div><div class="p">They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>35&#160;</sup>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="16">16</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>But he answered them, <span class="wj">“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ </span> 
<sup>3&#160;</sup><span class="wj">In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! </span> 
<sup>4&#160;</sup><span class="wj">An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">He left them and departed. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Yahushua, perceiving it, said, <span class="wj">“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread? </span> 
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Don’t you yet perceive or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up, </span> 
<sup>10&#160;</sup><span class="wj">or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span> 
<sup>11&#160;</sup><span class="wj">How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Now when Yahushua came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class="wj">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“But who do you say that I am?”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living Elohim.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Yahushua answered him, <span class="wj">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span> 
<sup>18&#160;</sup><span class="wj">I also tell you that you are Peter,</span> <span class="wj">will not prevail against it. </span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”</span> 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Yahushua the Christ. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>From that time, Yahushua began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>But he turned and said to Peter, <span class="wj">“Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of Elohim, but on the things of men.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. </span> 
<sup>25&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. </span> 
<sup>26&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? </span> 
<sup>27&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds. </span> 
<sup>28&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.” </span> 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="17">17</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>After six days, Yahushua took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>He was changed before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Peter answered and said to Yahushua, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Yahushua came and touched them and said, <span class="wj">“Get up, and don’t be afraid.” </span> 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Yahushua alone. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>As they were coming down from the mountain, Yahushua commanded them, saying, <span class="wj">“Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahushua answered them, <span class="wj">“Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things; </span> 
<sup>12&#160;</sup><span class="wj">but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.”</span> 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him and saying, 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Yahushua answered, <span class="wj">“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”</span> 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Yahushua rebuked the demon, and it went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Then the disciples came to Yahushua privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. </span> 

</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>While they were staying in Galilee, Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, </span> 
<sup>23&#160;</sup><span class="wj">and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.” </span> 
</div><div class="p">They were exceedingly sorry. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?” 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>He said, “Yes.” 
</div><div class="p">When he came into the house, Yahushua anticipated him, saying, <span class="wj">“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Peter said to him, “From strangers.” 
</div><div class="p">Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“Therefore the children are exempt. </span> 
<sup>27&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin.</span> <span class="wj">Take that, and give it to them for me and you.”</span> 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="18">18</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In that hour the disciples came to Yahushua, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahushua called a little child to himself, and set him in the middle of them 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and said, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. </span> 
<sup>4&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. </span> 
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me, </span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a huge millstone were hung around his neck and that he were sunk in the depths of the sea. </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes! </span> 
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. </span> 
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna</span> <span class="wj">of fire. </span> 
<sup>10&#160;</sup><span class="wj">See that you don’t despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. </span> 

</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray? </span> 
<sup>13&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. </span> 
<sup>14&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother. </span> 
<sup>16&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span> 
<sup>17&#160;</sup><span class="wj">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. </span> 
<sup>18&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven. </span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. </span> 
<sup>20&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the middle of them.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven. </span> 
<sup>23&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. </span> 
<sup>24&#160;</sup><span class="wj">When he had begun to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> 
<sup>25&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his woman, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. </span> 
<sup>26&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The servant therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’ </span> 
<sup>27&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>28&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred denarii,</span> <span class="wj">and he grabbed him and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’ </span> 
<sup>30&#160;</sup><span class="wj">He would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay back that which was due. </span> 
<sup>31&#160;</sup><span class="wj">So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told their lord all that was done. </span> 
<sup>32&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Then his lord called him in and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. </span> 
<sup>33&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ </span> 
<sup>34&#160;</sup><span class="wj">His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him. </span> 
<sup>35&#160;</sup><span class="wj">So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.”</span> 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="19">19</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>When Yahushua had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his woman for any reason?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He answered, <span class="wj">“Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,</span> 
<sup>5&#160;</sup><span class="wj">and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his woman; and the two shall become one flesh’?</span> 
<sup>6&#160;</sup><span class="wj">So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore Elohim has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to put away your women, but from the beginning it has not been so. </span> 
<sup>9&#160;</sup><span class="wj">I tell you that whoever puts away his woman, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is put away commits adultery.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man with his woman, it is not expedient to marry.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>But he said to them, <span class="wj">“Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given. </span> 
<sup>12&#160;</sup><span class="wj">For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.”</span>

<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then little children were brought to him that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.

<sup>10&#160;</sup>When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”

<sup>12&#160;</sup>Yahushua entered into the temple of Elohim and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.

<sup>14&#160;</sup>The lame and the blind came to him in the temple, and he healed them.

<sup>24&#160;</sup>Yahushua answered them, <span class="wj">“I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span>

<sup>33&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country. </span>

<sup>35&#160;</sup><span class="wj">The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another. </span> 
<sup>36&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Again, he sent other servants more than the first; and they treated them the same way. </span>

<sup>7&#160;</sup><span class="wj">When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup><span class="wj">“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy. </span>

</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of Elohim in truth, no matter whom you teach; for you aren’t partial to anyone. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
</div><div class="p">

<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Show me the tax money.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">They brought to him a denarius.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>37&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“&#160;‘You shall love the Lord your Elohim with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</span>

<sup>39&#160;</sup><span class="wj">A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span>

<sup>41&#160;</sup>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Yahushua asked them a question,

<sup>39&#160;</sup>He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="wj">“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>40&#160;</sup>He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="wj">“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? </span> 
<sup>41&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>42&#160;</sup>Again, a second time he went away and prayed, saying, <span class="wj">“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.” </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>43&#160;</sup>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
<sup>44&#160;</sup>He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words. 
<sup>45&#160;</sup>Then he came to his disciples and said to them, <span class="wj">“Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span> 
<sup>46&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>47&#160;</sup>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
<sup>48&#160;</sup>Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.” 
<sup>49&#160;</sup>Immediately he came to Yahushua, and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>50&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“Friend, why are you here?”</span> 
</div><div class="p">Then they came and laid hands on Yahushua, and took him. 
<sup>51&#160;</sup>Behold, one of those who were with Yahushua stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>52&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. </span> 
<sup>53&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? </span> 
<sup>54&#160;</sup><span class="wj">How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” </span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>55&#160;</sup>In that hour Yahushua said to the multitudes, <span class="wj">“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. </span> 
<sup>56&#160;</sup><span class="wj">But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">Then all the disciples left him and fled. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>57&#160;</sup>Those who had taken Yahushua led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 
<sup>58&#160;</sup>But Peter followed him from a distance to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>59&#160;</sup>Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Yahushua, that they might put him to death, 
<sup>60&#160;</sup>and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward 
<sup>61&#160;</sup>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of Elohim, and to build it in three days.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>62&#160;</sup>The high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?” 
<sup>63&#160;</sup>But Yahushua stayed silent. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living Elohim that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of Elohim.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>64&#160;</sup>Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“You have said so. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Yahweh, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>65&#160;</sup>Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. 
<sup>66&#160;</sup>What do you think?” 
</div><div class="p">They answered, “He is worthy of death!” 
<sup>67&#160;</sup>Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, 
<sup>68&#160;</sup>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>69&#160;</sup>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Yahushua, the Galilean!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>70&#160;</sup>But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>71&#160;</sup>When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Yahushua of Nazareth.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>72&#160;</sup>Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>73&#160;</sup>After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>74&#160;</sup>Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” 
</div><div class="p">Immediately the rooster crowed. 
<sup>75&#160;</sup>Peter remembered the word which Yahushua had said to him, <span class="wj">“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> Then he went out and wept bitterly. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="27">27</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Yahushua to put him to death. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>They bound him, led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Yahushua was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.” 
</div><div class="p">But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Therefore that field has been called “The Field of Blood” to this day. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">“They took the thirty pieces of silver, 
</div><div class="q2">the price of him upon whom a price had been set, 
</div><div class="q2">whom some of the children of Israel priced, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>and they gave them for the potter’s field, 
</div><div class="q2">as the Lord commanded me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Now Yahushua stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 
</div><div class="p">Yahushua said to him, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>They had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Yahushua who is called Christ?” 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his woman sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Yahushua. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” 
</div><div class="p">They said, “Barabbas!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Yahushua who is called Christ?” 
</div><div class="p">They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?” 
</div><div class="p">But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>All the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Then he released Barabbas to them, but Yahushua he flogged and delivered to be crucified. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Then the governor’s soldiers took Yahushua into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,” 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>they gave him sour wine When he had tasted it, he would not drink. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots, 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>and they sat and watched him there. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS YAHUSHUA, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>38&#160;</sup>Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>39&#160;</sup>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>and saying, “You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of Elohim, come down from the cross!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>41&#160;</sup>Likewise the chief priests also mocking with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said, 
<sup>42&#160;</sup>“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. 
<sup>43&#160;</sup>He trusts in Elohim. Let Elohim deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of Elohim.’&#160;” 
<sup>44&#160;</sup>The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>45&#160;</sup>Now from the sixth hour 
<sup>46&#160;</sup>About the ninth hour Yahushua cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="wj">“Eli, Eli, lima</span> <span class="wj">sabachthani?” </span> That is, <span class="wj">“My Elohim, my Elohim, why have you forsaken me?”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>47&#160;</sup>Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>48&#160;</sup>Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. 
<sup>49&#160;</sup>The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>50&#160;</sup>Yahushua cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>51&#160;</sup>Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. 
<sup>52&#160;</sup>The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; 
<sup>53&#160;</sup>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the set-apart city and appeared to many. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>54&#160;</sup>Now the centurion and those who were with him watching Yahushua, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done, were terrified, saying, “Truly this was the Son of Elohim!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>55&#160;</sup>Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Yahushua from Galilee, serving him. 
<sup>56&#160;</sup>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>57&#160;</sup>When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph, who himself was also Yahushua’s disciple, came. 
<sup>58&#160;</sup>This man went to Pilate and asked for Yahushua’s body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. 
<sup>59&#160;</sup>Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth 
<sup>60&#160;</sup>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. 
<sup>61&#160;</sup>Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>62&#160;</sup>Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, 
<sup>63&#160;</sup>saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’ 
<sup>64&#160;</sup>Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>65&#160;</sup>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.” 
<sup>66&#160;</sup>So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="28">28</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Yahushua, who has been crucified. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Yahushua met them, saying, <span class="wj">“Rejoice!”</span> 
</div><div class="p">They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then Yahushua said to them, <span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers </span> <span class="wj">that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”</span> 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>saying, “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Yahushua had sent them. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Yahushua came to them and spoke to them, saying, <span class="wj">“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. </span> 
<sup>19&#160;</sup><span class="wj">Go</span> <span class="wj"> </span> 
<sup>20&#160;</sup><span class="wj">and teach them to carry out all the things which I have commanded you forever.”</span> </div></div><script src="../main.js"></script></body></html>
