<sup>2&#160;</sup>Your body is like a round goblet, 
</p><p class="q2">no mixed wine is wanting. 
</p><p class="q1">Your waist is like a heap of wheat, 
</p><p class="q2">set about with lilies. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Your two breasts are like two fawns, 
</p><p class="q2">that are twins of a roe. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Your neck is like an ivory tower. 
</p><p class="q2">Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim. 
</p><p class="q2">Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Your head on you is like Carmel. 
</p><p class="q2">The hair of your head like purple. 
</p><p class="q2">The king is held captive in its tresses. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>How beautiful and how pleasant you are, 
</p><p class="q2">love, for delights! 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>This, your stature, is like a palm tree, 
</p><p class="q2">your breasts like its fruit. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree. 
</p><p class="q2">I will take hold of its fruit.” 
</p><p class="q1">Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, 
</p><p class="q2">the smell of your breath like apples. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Your mouth is like the best wine, 
</p><p class="q2">that goes down smoothly for my beloved, 
</p><p class="q2">gliding through the lips of those who are asleep. 
</p><p class="sp">Beloved

<sup>11&#160;</sup>Come, my beloved! Let’s go out into the field. 
</p><p class="q2">Let’s lodge in the villages. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Let’s go early up to the vineyards. 
</p><p class="q2">Let’s see whether the vine has budded,

</p><p class="q2">and the pomegranates are in flower. 
</p><p class="q2">There I will give you my love. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>The mandrakes produce fragrance. 
</p><p class="q2">At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old,

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Oh that you were like my brother, 
</p><p class="q2">who nursed from the breasts of my mother! 
</p><p class="q1">If I found you outside, I would kiss you; 
</p><p class="q2">yes, and no one would despise me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother, 
</p><p class="q2">who would instruct me. 
</p><p class="q1">I would have you drink spiced wine, 
</p><p class="q2">of the juice of my pomegranate.

<p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,

<p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Set me as a seal on your heart, 
</p><p class="q2">as a seal on your arm;

</p><p class="q2">Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol. 
</p><p class="q2">Its flashes are flashes of fire,

<sup>7&#160;</sup>Many waters can’t quench love, 
</p><p class="q2">neither can floods drown it. 
</p><p class="q1">If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,
