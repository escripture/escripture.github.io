<p class="p1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Hear, heavens, 
</p><p class="q2">and listen, earth; for Yahweh<span class="f">+ \fr 1:2 \ft “Yahweh” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> has spoken: 
</p><p class="q1">“I have nourished and brought up children 
</p><p class="q2">and they have rebelled against me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>The ox knows his owner, 
</p><p class="q2">and the donkey his master’s crib; 
</p><p class="q2">but Israel doesn’t know. 
</p><p class="q2">My people don’t consider.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Ah sinful nation, 
</p><p class="q2">a people loaded with iniquity, 
</p><p class="q2">offspring<span class="f">+ \fr 1:4 \ft or, seed</span> of evildoers, 
</p><p class="q2">children who deal corruptly! 
</p><p class="q1">They have forsaken Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q2">They have despised the Set-Apart One of Israel. 
</p><p class="q2">They are estranged and backward. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Why should you be beaten more, 
</p><p class="q2">that you revolt more and more? 
</p><p class="q1">The whole head is sick, 
</p><p class="q2">and the whole heart faint. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, 
</p><p class="q2">but wounds, welts, and open sores. 
</p><p class="q2">They haven’t been closed, bandaged, or soothed with oil. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Your country is desolate. 
</p><p class="q2">Your cities are burned with fire. 
</p><p class="q2">Strangers devour your land in your presence 
</p><p class="q2">and it is desolate, 
</p><p class="q2">as overthrown by strangers. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, 
</p><p class="q2">like a hut in a field of melons, 
</p><p class="q2">like a besieged city. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant, 
</p><p class="q2">we would have been as Sodom. 
</p><p class="q2">We would have been like Gomorrah. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Hear Yahweh’s word, you rulers of Sodom! 
</p><p class="q2">Listen to the law of our Elohim,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:10 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> you people of Gomorrah! 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>“What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”, says Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q2">“I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams 
</p><p class="q2">and the fat of fed animals. 
</p><p class="q2">I don’t delight in the blood of bulls, 
</p><p class="q2">or of lambs, 
</p><p class="q2">or of male goats. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>When you come to appear before me, 
</p><p class="q2">who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Bring no more vain offerings. 
</p><p class="q2">Incense is an abomination to me. 
</p><p class="q2">New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations—</p><p class="q2">I can’t stand evil assemblies. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts. 
</p><p class="q2">They are a burden to me. 
</p><p class="q2">I am weary of bearing them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. 
</p><p class="q2">Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear. 
</p><p class="q2">Your hands are full of blood. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Wash yourselves. Make yourself clean. 
</p><p class="q2">Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. 
</p><p class="q2">Cease to do evil. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Learn to do well. 
</p><p class="q2">Seek justice. 
</p><p class="q2">Relieve the oppressed. 
</p><p class="q1">Defend the fatherless. 
</p><p class="q2">Plead for the widow.” 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>“Come now, and let’s reason together,” says Yahweh: 
</p><p class="q2">“Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. 
</p><p class="q2">Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>If you are willing and obedient, 
</p><p class="q2">you will eat the good of the land; 
</p><p class="q2">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword; 
</p><p class="q2">for Yahweh’s mouth has spoken it.” 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>How the faithful city has become a prostitute! 
</p><p class="q2">She was full of justice. 
</p><p class="q1">Righteousness lodged in her, 
</p><p class="q2">but now there are murderers. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Your silver has become dross, 
</p><p class="q2">your wine mixed with water. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves. 
</p><p class="q2">Everyone loves bribes and follows after rewards. 
</p><p class="q2">They don’t defend the fatherless, 
</p><p class="q2">neither does the cause of the widow come to them. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:24 \ft The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.” </span> Yahweh of Armies, 
</p><p class="q2">the Mighty One of Israel, says: 
</p><p class="q1">“Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries, 
</p><p class="q2">and avenge myself on my enemies. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>I will turn my hand on you, 
</p><p class="q2">thoroughly purge away your dross, 
</p><p class="q2">and will take away all your tin.<span class="f">+ \fr 1:25 \ft tin is a metal that is separated from silver during the refining and purification process.</span> 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>I will restore your judges as at the first, 
</p><p class="q2">and your counselors as at the beginning. 
</p><p class="q1">Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness, 
</p><p class="q2">a faithful town.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, 
</p><p class="q2">and her converts with righteousness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, 
</p><p class="q2">and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, 
</p><p class="q2">and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, 
</p><p class="q2">and as a garden that has no water. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>The strong will be like tinder, 
</p><p class="q2">and his work like a spark.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Many peoples shall go and say,

<span class="v">4&#160;</span>He will judge between the nations,

<span class="v">5&#160;</span>House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of Yahweh.

<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,

</p><p class="q2">and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.

<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Their land is full of silver and gold,

<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Man is brought low,

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>One called to another, and said, 
</p><p class="q1">“Set-Apart, set-apart, set-apart, is Yahweh of Armies! 
</p><p class="q2">The whole earth is full of his glory!” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” 
</p><p>Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>He said, “Go, and tell this people, 
</p><p class="q1">‘You hear indeed, 
</p><p class="q2">but don’t understand. 
</p><p class="q1">You see indeed,

</p><p class="q2">and turn again, and be healed.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Then I said, “Lord, how long?” 
</p><p>He answered,

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying, 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.” 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>This is what the Lord Yahweh says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.” 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>“Ask a sign of Yahweh your Elohim; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt Yahweh.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my Elohim also? 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the young woman will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.<span class="f">+ \fr 7:14 \ft “Immanuel” means “Elohim with us”.</span> 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah, even the king of Assyria. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>It shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter, for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left within the land. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels,<span class="f">+ \fr 7:23 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 1000 shekels is about 10 kilograms or 22 pounds.</span> will be for briers and thorns. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for sheep to tread on.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="8">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’;<span class="f">+ \fr 8:1 \ft “Maher Shalal Hash Baz” means “quick to the plunder, swift to the prey”.</span> 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’ 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father’ and ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying, 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through. It will reach even to the neck. The stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, O Immanuel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered! 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand, for Elohim is with us.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>For Yahweh spoke this to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>“Don’t call a conspiracy all that this people call a conspiracy. Don’t fear their threats or be terrorized. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as set-apart. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stumbling stone and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Wrap up the covenant. Seal the law among my disciples. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter,” shouldn’t a people consult with their Elohim? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Turn to the law and to the covenant! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry. It will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse their king and their Elohim. They will turn their faces upward, 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>then look to the earth and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="9">9</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. 
</p><p class="q2">The light has shined on those who lived in the land of the shadow of death. 
</p><p class="q1">

<span class="v">4&#160;</span>For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For a child is born to us. A son is given to us; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty Elohim, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on David’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and it falls on Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">

<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Should an ax brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Set-Apart One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>He will consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh, the Set-Apart One of Israel, in truth. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty Elohim. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end, and that determined, throughout all the earth. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says, “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Egypt did. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.” 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth! 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low. 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.

<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,<span class="f">+ \fr 14:11 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead. </span> with the sound of your stringed instruments. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you.

<span class="v">13&#160;</span>You said in your heart, “I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of Elohim! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!” 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,<span class="f">+ \fr 14:15 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.</span> to the depths of the pit.

<span class="v">19&#160;</span>But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body trodden under foot. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will not be named forever. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>“I will rise up against them,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son’s son,” says Yahweh. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>“I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says Yahweh of Armies.

<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Yahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, “Surely, as I have thought, so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.

<span class="v">2&#160;</span>They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every beard is cut off. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails, weeping abundantly. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud. Their souls tremble within them. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>My heart cries out for Moab! Her nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for on the way to Horonaim, they raise up a cry of destruction. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab who escape, and on the remnant of the land.

<span class="v">6&#160;</span>We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Therefore Moab will wail for Moab. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth, utterly stricken. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah. The owners of the nations have broken down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread out wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir Heres. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail.

<span class="v">13&#160;</span>This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as a worker bound by contract would count them, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant will be very small and feeble.”

<span class="v">6&#160;</span>The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings”? 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, those who are the cornerstone of her tribes. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of Yahweh of Armies’s hand, which he shakes over them. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called “The city of destruction.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender, and he will deliver them. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth; 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it; 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist, and take your sandals from off your feet.” He did so, walking naked and barefoot. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Yahweh said, “As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia, 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. And we, how will we escape?’&#160;”

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>The burden of the wilderness of the sea. 
</p><p>As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I am so dismayed that I can’t see. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield! 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.” 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her elohims are broken to the ground. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, I have declared to you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>The burden of Dumah. 
</p><p>One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?” 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>The burden on Arabia. 
</p><p>You will lodge in the thickets in Arabia, you caravans of Dedanites. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>For the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, has spoken it.”

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>The burden of the valley of vision. 
</p><p>What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops? 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town, your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.” 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You saw the breaches of David’s city, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth; 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>and behold, there is joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.” 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>The Lord, Yahweh of Armies says, “Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>‘What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?’ Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!” 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you disgrace of your lord’s house. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>I will lay the key of David’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father’s house. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>“In that day,” says Yahweh of Armies, “the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way. It will be cut down and fall. The burden that was on it will be cut off, for Yahweh has spoken it.”

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>The burden of Tyre. 
</p><p>Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon that pass over the sea have replenished. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue. She was the market of nations. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed, nor given birth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.” 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Pass over to Tarshish! Wail, you inhabitants of the coast! 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel? 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honorable of the earth? 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no restraint any more. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan’s strongholds. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>He said, “You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people didn’t exist. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste! 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre. She will return to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Her merchandise and her wages will be set-apartness to Yahweh. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

<span class="v">3&#160;</span>The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.

<span class="v">18&#160;</span>It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.

<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.

<span class="v">2&#160;</span>In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard! 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed? 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship Yahweh in the set-apart mountain at Jerusalem.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine! 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer, which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the residue of his people, 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgment. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts? 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to the weary,” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh’s word will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken, be snared, and be taken. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem: 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>“Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are in agreement with Sheol.<span class="f">+ \fr 28:15 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.</span> When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’&#160;” 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol<span class="f">+ \fr 28:18 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.</span> shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.” 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the whole earth. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech! 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods? 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place? 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>For his Elohim instructs him in right judgment and teaches him. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>For the dill isn’t threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>This also comes out from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="29">29</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come around; 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.<span class="f">+ \fr 29:2 \ft or, Ariel</span> 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered your heads, the seers. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed;” 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t read.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and honors me with their lips, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught; 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?” 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay, that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding”? 
</p><p>
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest? 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Set-Apart One of Israel. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off—<span class="v">21&#160;</span>who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for one who reproves in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Set-Apart One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the Elohim of Israel. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="30">30</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>“Woe to the rebellious children”, says Yahweh, “who take counsel, but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin; 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>who set out to go down into Egypt without asking for my advice, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt! 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>The burden of the animals of the South. 
</p><p>Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear Yahweh’s law; 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Get out of the way. Turn away from the path. Cause the Set-Apart One of Israel to cease from before us.” 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Therefore the Set-Apart One of Israel says, “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it, 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won’t be found among the broken pieces a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Set-Apart One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses;” therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the swift;” therefore those who pursue you will be swift. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you, for Yahweh is an Elohim of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers won’t be hidden any more, but your eyes will see your teachers; 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.” 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>There will be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they were struck with. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Behold, Yahweh’s name comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation. His tongue is as a devouring fire. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. A bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>You will have a song, as in the night when a set-apart feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh’s mountain, to Israel’s Rock. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>For through Yahweh’s voice the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike him with his rod. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons. 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>For his burning place has long been ready. Yes, it is prepared for the king. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Yahweh’s breath, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the recorder came out to him. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says, “What confidence is this in which you trust? 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our Elohim,’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar’?” 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?” 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us. This city won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”&#160;’ 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.” Have any of the elohims of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Where are the elohims of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the elohims of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Who are they among all the elohims of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="37">37</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh’s house. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to give birth. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>It may be Yahweh your Elohim will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living Elohim, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your Elohim has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your Elohim in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered? 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Have the elohims of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>“Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, who is enthroned among the cherubim, you are the Elohim, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold. Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living Elohim. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land, 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>and have cast their elohims into the fire; for they were no elohims, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Now therefore, Yahweh our Elohim, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, even you only.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Set-Apart One of Israel. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>By your servants, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>“&#160;‘Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them into ruinous heaps. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like a field before its crop has grown. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>“&#160;‘This shall be the sign to you: You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from it; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.’ 
</p><p>
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>“Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it. 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>He will return the way that he came, and he won’t come to this city,’ says Yahweh. 
<span class="v">35&#160;</span>‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">36&#160;</span>Then Yahweh’s angel went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. 
<span class="v">37&#160;</span>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and stayed there. 
<span class="v">38&#160;</span>As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his elohim, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>and said, “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Isaiah, saying, 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>“Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the Elohim of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.”&#160;’&#160;” So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.

<span class="v">9&#160;</span>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness: 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.<span class="f">+ \fr 38:10 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.</span> 
</p><p class="q2">I am deprived of the residue of my years.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>I said, “I won’t see Yah, 
</p><p class="q2">Yah in the land of the living. 
</p><p class="q2">I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>My dwelling is removed, 
</p><p class="q2">and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent. 
</p><p class="q1">I have rolled up my life like a weaver. 
</p><p class="q2">He will cut me off from the loom. 
</p><p class="q2">From day even to night you will make an end of me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>I waited patiently until morning. 
</p><p class="q2">He breaks all my bones like a lion. 
</p><p class="q2">From day even to night you will make an end of me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>I chattered like a swallow or a crane. 
</p><p class="q2">I moaned like a dove. 
</p><p class="q2">My eyes weaken looking upward. 
</p><p class="q2">Lord, I am oppressed. 
</p><p class="q2">Be my security.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>What will I say? 
</p><p class="q2">He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it. 
</p><p class="q2">I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Lord, men live by these things; 
</p><p class="q2">and my spirit finds life in all of them. 
</p><p class="q2">You restore me, and cause me to live. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Behold, for peace I had great anguish, 
</p><p class="q2">but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; 
</p><p class="q2">for you have cast all my sins behind your back. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>For Sheol<span class="f">+ \fr 38:18 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.</span> can’t praise you. 
</p><p class="q2">Death can’t celebrate you. 
</p><p class="q1">Those who go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do today. 
</p><p class="q2">The father shall make known your truth to the children. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Yahweh will save me. 
</p><p class="q2">Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in Yahweh’s house. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.” 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to Yahweh’s house?” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="39">39</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>At that time, Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” 
</p><p>Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?” 
</p><p>Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies: 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon’s palace.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”
