</div><div class="q2">neither will there be any more after them, 
</div><div class="q2">even to the years of many generations. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>A fire devours before them,

<sup>4&#160;</sup>Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, 
</div><div class="q2">and they run as horsemen. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap, 
</div><div class="q2">like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, 
</div><div class="q2">like a strong people set in battle array. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>At their presence the peoples are in anguish. 
</div><div class="q2">All faces have grown pale. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They run like mighty men. 
</div><div class="q2">They climb the wall like warriors. 
</div><div class="q2">They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>One doesn’t jostle another. 
</div><div class="q2">They each march in their own path. 
</div><div class="q2">They burst through the defenses 
</div><div class="q2">and don’t break ranks. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>They rush on the city. 
</div><div class="q2">They run on the wall. 
</div><div class="q2">They climb up into the houses. 
</div><div class="q2">They enter in at the windows like thieves. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The earth quakes before them. 
</div><div class="q2">The heavens tremble. 
</div><div class="q2">The sun and the moon are darkened, 
</div><div class="q2">and the stars withdraw their shining. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh thunders his voice before his army,

</div><div class="q2">and who can endure it? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,

</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Tear your heart and not your garments, 
</div><div class="q2">and turn to Yahweh, your Elohim; 
</div><div class="q2">for he is gracious and merciful, 
</div><div class="q2">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, 
</div><div class="q2">and relents from sending calamity. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Who knows? He may turn and relent, 
</div><div class="q2">and leave a blessing behind him, 
</div><div class="q2">even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your Elohim. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Blow the trumpet in Zion! 
</div><div class="q2">Sanctify a fast. 
</div><div class="q2">Call a solemn assembly. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Gather the people. 
</div><div class="q2">Sanctify the assembly. 
</div><div class="q2">Assemble the elders. 
</div><div class="q2">Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts. 
</div><div class="q1">Let the bridegroom go out of his room, 
</div><div class="q2">and the bride out of her chamber. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, 
</div><div class="q2">and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">and don’t give your heritage to reproach, 
</div><div class="q2">that the nations should rule over them. 
</div><div class="q1">Why should they say among the peoples, 
</div><div class="q2">‘Where is their Elohim?’&#160;” 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, 
</div><div class="q2">and had pity on his people. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yahweh answered his people, 
</div><div class="q2">“Behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 2:19 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, 
</div><div class="q2">and you will be satisfied with them; 
</div><div class="q2">and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>But I will remove the northern army far away from you, 
</div><div class="q2">and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, 
</div><div class="q2">its front into the eastern sea, 
</div><div class="q2">and its back into the western sea; 
</div><div class="q2">and its stench will come up, 
</div><div class="q2">and its bad smell will rise.” 
</div><div class="q1">Surely he has done great things. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Land, don’t be afraid. 
</div><div class="q2">Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field; 
</div><div class="q2">for the pastures of the wilderness spring up, 
</div><div class="q2">for the tree bears its fruit. 
</div><div class="q2">The fig tree and the vine yield their strength. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>“Be glad then, you children of Zion, 
</div><div class="q2">and rejoice in Yahweh, your Elohim; 
</div><div class="q2">for he gives you the early rain in just measure, 
</div><div class="q2">and he causes the rain to come down for you, 
</div><div class="q2">the early rain and the latter rain, as before. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The threshing floors will be full of wheat, 
</div><div class="q2">and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, 
</div><div class="q2">the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar, 
</div><div class="q2">my great army, which I sent among you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied, 
</div><div class="q2">and will praise the name of Yahweh, your Elohim, 
</div><div class="q2">who has dealt wondrously with you; 
</div><div class="q2">and my people will never again be disappointed. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>You will know that I am among Israel, 
</div><div class="q2">and that I am Yahweh, your Elohim, and there is no one else; 
</div><div class="q2">and my people will never again be disappointed. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; 
</div><div class="q2">and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. 
</div><div class="q2">Your old men will dream dreams. 
</div><div class="q2">Your young men will see visions. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days, 
</div><div class="q2">I will pour out my Spirit. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: 
</div><div class="q2">blood, fire, and pillars of smoke. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>The sun will be turned into darkness, 
</div><div class="q2">and the moon into blood, 
</div><div class="q2">before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved; 
</div><div class="q2">for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, 
</div><div class="q2">as Yahweh has said, 
</div><div class="q2">and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“For, behold, in those days, 
</div><div class="q2">and in that time, 
</div><div class="q2">when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,

<sup>2&#160;</sup>I will gather all nations, 
</div><div class="q2">and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; 
</div><div class="q2">and I will execute judgment on them there for my people, 
</div><div class="q2">and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. 
</div><div class="q2">They have divided my land, 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and have cast lots for my people,
