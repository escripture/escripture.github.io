<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Yahweh’s<span class="f">+ \fr 1:1 \ft “Yahweh” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Hear this, you elders, 
</p><p class="q2">and listen, all you inhabitants of the land! 
</p><p class="q1">Has this ever happened in your days, 
</p><p class="q2">or in the days of your fathers? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Tell your children about it, 
</p><p class="q2">and have your children tell their children, 
</p><p class="q2">and their children, another generation. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten. 
</p><p class="q2">What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten. 
</p><p class="q2">What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! 
</p><p class="q2">Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, 
</p><p class="q2">for it is cut off from your mouth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number. 
</p><p class="q2">His teeth are the teeth of a lion, 
</p><p class="q2">and he has the fangs of a lioness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>He has laid my vine waste, 
</p><p class="q2">and stripped my fig tree. 
</p><p class="q2">He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away. 
</p><p class="q2">Its branches are made white. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth 
</p><p class="q2">for the owner of her youth! 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house. 
</p><p class="q2">The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>The field is laid waste. 
</p><p class="q2">The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed, 
</p><p class="q2">The new wine has dried up, 
</p><p class="q2">and the oil languishes. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Be confounded, you farmers! 
</p><p class="q2">Wail, you vineyard keepers, 
</p><p class="q2">for the wheat and for the barley; 
</p><p class="q2">for the harvest of the field has perished. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered—</p><p class="q2">the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, 
</p><p class="q2">even all of the trees of the field are withered; 
</p><p class="q2">for joy has withered away from the sons of men. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests! 
</p><p class="q2">Wail, you ministers of the altar. 
</p><p class="q1">Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my Elohim,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:13 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> 
</p><p class="q2">for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your Elohim’s house. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Sanctify a fast. 
</p><p class="q2">Call a solemn assembly. 
</p><p class="q2">Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Yahweh, your Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">and cry to Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Alas for the day! 
</p><p class="q2">For the day of Yahweh is at hand, 
</p><p class="q2">and it will come as destruction from the Almighty. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes, 
</p><p class="q2">joy and gladness from the house of our Elohim? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>The seeds rot under their clods. 
</p><p class="q2">The granaries are laid desolate. 
</p><p class="q2">The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>How the animals groan! 
</p><p class="q2">The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture. 
</p><p class="q2">Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Yahweh, I cry to you, 
</p><p class="q2">for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">and the flame has burned all the trees of the field. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Yes, the animals of the field pant to you, 
</p><p class="q2">for the water brooks have dried up, 
</p><p class="q2">and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

<p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Blow the trumpet in Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">and sound an alarm in my set-apart mountain! 
</p><p class="q1">Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, 
</p><p class="q2">for the day of Yahweh comes, 
</p><p class="q2">for it is close at hand: 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>A day of darkness and gloominess, 
</p><p class="q2">a day of clouds and thick darkness. 
</p><p class="q1">As the dawn spreading on the mountains, 
</p><p class="q2">a great and strong people; 
</p><p class="q2">there has never been the like, 
</p><p class="q2">neither will there be any more after them, 
</p><p class="q2">even to the years of many generations. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>A fire devours before them, 
</p><p class="q2">and behind them, a flame burns. 
</p><p class="q1">The land is as the garden of Eden before them, 
</p><p class="q2">and behind them, a desolate wilderness. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, and no one has escaped them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, 
</p><p class="q2">and they run as horsemen. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap, 
</p><p class="q2">like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, 
</p><p class="q2">like a strong people set in battle array. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>At their presence the peoples are in anguish. 
</p><p class="q2">All faces have grown pale. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>They run like mighty men. 
</p><p class="q2">They climb the wall like warriors. 
</p><p class="q2">They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>One doesn’t jostle another. 
</p><p class="q2">They each march in their own path. 
</p><p class="q2">They burst through the defenses 
</p><p class="q2">and don’t break ranks. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>They rush on the city. 
</p><p class="q2">They run on the wall. 
</p><p class="q2">They climb up into the houses. 
</p><p class="q2">They enter in at the windows like thieves. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>The earth quakes before them. 
</p><p class="q2">The heavens tremble. 
</p><p class="q2">The sun and the moon are darkened, 
</p><p class="q2">and the stars withdraw their shining. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Yahweh thunders his voice before his army, 
</p><p class="q2">for his forces are very great; 
</p><p class="q2">for he is strong who obeys his command; 
</p><p class="q2">for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome, 
</p><p class="q2">and who can endure it? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart, 
</p><p class="q2">and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Tear your heart and not your garments, 
</p><p class="q2">and turn to Yahweh, your Elohim; 
</p><p class="q2">for he is gracious and merciful, 
</p><p class="q2">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, 
</p><p class="q2">and relents from sending calamity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Who knows? He may turn and relent, 
</p><p class="q2">and leave a blessing behind him, 
</p><p class="q2">even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your Elohim. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Blow the trumpet in Zion! 
</p><p class="q2">Sanctify a fast. 
</p><p class="q2">Call a solemn assembly. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Gather the people. 
</p><p class="q2">Sanctify the assembly. 
</p><p class="q2">Assemble the elders. 
</p><p class="q2">Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts. 
</p><p class="q1">Let the bridegroom go out of his room, 
</p><p class="q2">and the bride out of her chamber. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, 
</p><p class="q2">and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">and don’t give your heritage to reproach, 
</p><p class="q2">that the nations should rule over them. 
</p><p class="q1">Why should they say among the peoples, 
</p><p class="q2">‘Where is their Elohim?’&#160;” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, 
</p><p class="q2">and had pity on his people. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Yahweh answered his people, 
</p><p class="q2">“Behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 2:19 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, 
</p><p class="q2">and you will be satisfied with them; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>But I will remove the northern army far away from you, 
</p><p class="q2">and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, 
</p><p class="q2">its front into the eastern sea, 
</p><p class="q2">and its back into the western sea; 
</p><p class="q2">and its stench will come up, 
</p><p class="q2">and its bad smell will rise.” 
</p><p class="q1">Surely he has done great things. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Land, don’t be afraid. 
</p><p class="q2">Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field; 
</p><p class="q2">for the pastures of the wilderness spring up, 
</p><p class="q2">for the tree bears its fruit. 
</p><p class="q2">The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.

<span class="v">23&#160;</span>“Be glad then, you children of Zion,

</p><p class="q2">and he causes the rain to come down for you, 
</p><p class="q2">the early rain and the latter rain, as before. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>The threshing floors will be full of wheat,

<span class="v">25&#160;</span>I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied, 
</p><p class="q2">and will praise the name of Yahweh, your Elohim,

</p><p class="q2">and my people will never again be disappointed. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>You will know that I am among Israel,

<span class="v">32&#160;</span>It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved;
