<p class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Hear this, you elders, 
</p><p class="q2">and listen, all you inhabitants of the land! 
</p><p class="q1">Has this ever happened in your days, 
</p><p class="q2">or in the days of your fathers? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Tell your children about it, 
</p><p class="q2">and have your children tell their children, 
</p><p class="q2">and their children, another generation. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten. 
</p><p class="q2">What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten. 
</p><p class="q2">What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! 
</p><p class="q2">Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, 
</p><p class="q2">for it is cut off from your mouth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number. 
</p><p class="q2">His teeth are the teeth of a lion, 
</p><p class="q2">and he has the fangs of a lioness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>He has laid my vine waste, 
</p><p class="q2">and stripped my fig tree. 
</p><p class="q2">He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away. 
</p><p class="q2">Its branches are made white. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth 
</p><p class="q2">for the owner of her youth! 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house. 
</p><p class="q2">The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The field is laid waste. 
</p><p class="q2">The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed, 
</p><p class="q2">The new wine has dried up, 
</p><p class="q2">and the oil languishes. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Be confounded, you farmers! 
</p><p class="q2">Wail, you vineyard keepers, 
</p><p class="q2">for the wheat and for the barley; 
</p><p class="q2">for the harvest of the field has perished. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered—</p><p class="q2">the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, 
</p><p class="q2">even all of the trees of the field are withered; 
</p><p class="q2">for joy has withered away from the sons of men. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests! 
</p><p class="q2">Wail, you ministers of the altar. 
</p><p class="q1">Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your Elohim’s house. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Sanctify a fast. 
</p><p class="q2">Call a solemn assembly. 
</p><p class="q2">Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Yahweh, your Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">and cry to Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Alas for the day! 
</p><p class="q2">For the day of Yahweh is at hand, 
</p><p class="q2">and it will come as destruction from the Almighty. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes, 
</p><p class="q2">joy and gladness from the house of our Elohim? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The seeds rot under their clods. 
</p><p class="q2">The granaries are laid desolate. 
</p><p class="q2">The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>How the animals groan! 
</p><p class="q2">The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture. 
</p><p class="q2">Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yahweh, I cry to you, 
</p><p class="q2">for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">and the flame has burned all the trees of the field. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Yes, the animals of the field pant to you, 
</p><p class="q2">for the water brooks have dried up, 
</p><p class="q2">and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Blow the trumpet in Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">and sound an alarm in my set-apart mountain! 
</p><p class="q1">Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, 
</p><p class="q2">for the day of Yahweh comes, 
</p><p class="q2">for it is close at hand: 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>A day of darkness and gloominess, 
</p><p class="q2">a day of clouds and thick darkness. 
</p><p class="q1">As the dawn spreading on the mountains, 
</p><p class="q2">a great and strong people; 
</p><p class="q2">there has never been the like, 
</p><p class="q2">neither will there be any more after them, 
</p><p class="q2">even to the years of many generations. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>A fire devours before them, 
</p><p class="q2">and behind them, a flame burns. 
</p><p class="q1">The land is as the garden of Eden before them, 
</p><p class="q2">and behind them, a desolate wilderness. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, and no one has escaped them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, 
</p><p class="q2">and they run as horsemen. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap, 
</p><p class="q2">like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, 
</p><p class="q2">like a strong people set in battle array. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>At their presence the peoples are in anguish. 
</p><p class="q2">All faces have grown pale. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They run like mighty men. 
</p><p class="q2">They climb the wall like warriors. 
</p><p class="q2">They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>One doesn’t jostle another. 
</p><p class="q2">They each march in their own path. 
</p><p class="q2">They burst through the defenses 
</p><p class="q2">and don’t break ranks. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>They rush on the city. 
</p><p class="q2">They run on the wall. 
</p><p class="q2">They climb up into the houses. 
</p><p class="q2">They enter in at the windows like thieves. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The earth quakes before them. 
</p><p class="q2">The heavens tremble. 
</p><p class="q2">The sun and the moon are darkened, 
</p><p class="q2">and the stars withdraw their shining. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh thunders his voice before his army, 
</p><p class="q2">for his forces are very great; 
</p><p class="q2">for he is strong who obeys his command; 
</p><p class="q2">for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome, 
</p><p class="q2">and who can endure it? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart, 
</p><p class="q2">and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Tear your heart and not your garments, 
</p><p class="q2">and turn to Yahweh, your Elohim; 
</p><p class="q2">for he is gracious and merciful, 
</p><p class="q2">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, 
</p><p class="q2">and relents from sending calamity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Who knows? He may turn and relent, 
</p><p class="q2">and leave a blessing behind him, 
</p><p class="q2">even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your Elohim. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Blow the trumpet in Zion! 
</p><p class="q2">Sanctify a fast. 
</p><p class="q2">Call a solemn assembly. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Gather the people. 
</p><p class="q2">Sanctify the assembly. 
</p><p class="q2">Assemble the elders. 
</p><p class="q2">Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts. 
</p><p class="q1">Let the bridegroom go out of his room, 
</p><p class="q2">and the bride out of her chamber. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, 
</p><p class="q2">and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">and don’t give your heritage to reproach, 
</p><p class="q2">that the nations should rule over them. 
</p><p class="q1">Why should they say among the peoples, 
</p><p class="q2">‘Where is their Elohim?’&#160;” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, 
</p><p class="q2">and had pity on his people. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yahweh answered his people, 
</p><p class="q2">“Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, 
</p><p class="q2">and you will be satisfied with them; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>But I will remove the northern army far away from you, 
</p><p class="q2">and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, 
</p><p class="q2">its front into the eastern sea, 
</p><p class="q2">and its back into the western sea; 
</p><p class="q2">and its stench will come up, 
</p><p class="q2">and its bad smell will rise.” 
</p><p class="q1">Surely he has done great things. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Land, don’t be afraid. 
</p><p class="q2">Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field; 
</p><p class="q2">for the pastures of the wilderness spring up, 
</p><p class="q2">for the tree bears its fruit. 
</p><p class="q2">The fig tree and the vine yield their strength. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>“Be glad then, you children of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">and rejoice in Yahweh, your Elohim; 
</p><p class="q2">for he gives you the early rain in just measure, 
</p><p class="q2">and he causes the rain to come down for you, 
</p><p class="q2">the early rain and the latter rain, as before. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The threshing floors will be full of wheat, 
</p><p class="q2">and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, 
</p><p class="q2">the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar, 
</p><p class="q2">my great army, which I sent among you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied, 
</p><p class="q2">and will praise the name of Yahweh, your Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">who has dealt wondrously with you; 
</p><p class="q2">and my people will never again be disappointed. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>You will know that I am among Israel, 
</p><p class="q2">and that I am Yahweh, your Elohim, and there is no one else; 
</p><p class="q2">and my people will never again be disappointed. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; 
</p><p class="q2">and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. 
</p><p class="q2">Your old men will dream dreams. 
</p><p class="q2">Your young men will see visions. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days, 
</p><p class="q2">I will pour out my Spirit. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: 
</p><p class="q2">blood, fire, and pillars of smoke. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>The sun will be turned into darkness, 
</p><p class="q2">and the moon into blood, 
</p><p class="q2">before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved; 
</p><p class="q2">for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, 
</p><p class="q2">as Yahweh has said, 
</p><p class="q2">and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“For, behold, in those days, 
</p><p class="q2">and in that time, 
</p><p class="q2">when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>I will gather all nations, 
</p><p class="q2">and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will execute judgment on them there for my people, 
</p><p class="q2">and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. 
</p><p class="q2">They have divided my land, 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and have cast lots for my people, 
</p><p class="q2">and have given a boy for a prostitute, 
</p><p class="q2">and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon, 
</p><p class="q2">and all the regions of Philistia? 
</p><p class="q1">Will you repay me? 
</p><p class="q2">And if you repay me, 
</p><p class="q2">I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Because you have taken my silver and my gold, 
</p><p class="q2">and have carried my finest treasures into your temples, 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, 
</p><p class="q2">that you may remove them far from their border. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them, 
</p><p class="q2">and will return your repayment on your own head; 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah, 
</p><p class="q2">and they will sell them to the men of Sheba, 
</p><p class="q2">to a faraway nation, 
</p><p class="q2">for Yahweh has spoken it.” 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Proclaim this among the nations: 
</p><p class="q2">“Prepare for war! 
</p><p class="q2">Stir up the mighty men. 
</p><p class="q1">Let all the warriors draw near. 
</p><p class="q2">Let them come up. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Beat your plowshares into swords, 
</p><p class="q2">and your pruning hooks into spears. 
</p><p class="q2">Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, 
</p><p class="q2">and gather yourselves together.” 
</p><p class="q1">Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Let the nations arouse themselves, 
</p><p class="q2">and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; 
</p><p class="q2">for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Put in the sickle; 
</p><p class="q2">for the harvest is ripe. 
</p><p class="q2">Come, tread, for the wine press is full, 
</p><p class="q2">the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! 
</p><p class="q2">For the day of Yahweh is near in the valley of decision. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The sun and the moon are darkened, 
</p><p class="q2">and the stars withdraw their shining. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Yahweh will roar from Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">and thunder from Jerusalem; 
</p><p class="q2">and the heavens and the earth will shake; 
</p><p class="q2">but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people, 
</p><p class="q2">and a stronghold to the children of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“So you will know that I am Yahweh, your Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">dwelling in Zion, my set-apart mountain. 
</p><p class="q1">Then Jerusalem will be set-apart, 
</p><p class="q2">and no strangers will pass through her any more. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>It will happen in that day, 
</p><p class="q2">that the mountains will drop down sweet wine, 
</p><p class="q2">the hills will flow with milk, 
</p><p class="q2">all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters; 
</p><p class="q2">and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house, 
</p><p class="q2">and will water the valley of Shittim. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Egypt will be a desolation 
</p><p class="q2">and Edom will be a desolate wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">for the violence done to the children of Judah, 
</p><p class="q2">because they have shed innocent blood in their land. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>But Judah will be inhabited forever, 
</p><p class="q2">and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I will cleanse their blood 
</p><p class="q2">that I have not cleansed,
