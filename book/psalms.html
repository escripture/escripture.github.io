<p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, 
</p><p class="q2">nor stand on the path of sinners, 
</p><p class="q2">nor sit in the seat of scoffers; 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>but his delight is in Yahweh’s<span class="f">+ \fr 1:2 \ft “Yahweh” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> law. 
</p><p class="q2">On his law he meditates day and night. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, 
</p><p class="q2">that produces its fruit in its season, 
</p><p class="q2">whose leaf also does not wither. 
</p><p class="q2">Whatever he does shall prosper. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>The wicked are not so, 
</p><p class="q2">but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, 
</p><p class="q2">nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, 
</p><p class="q2">but the way of the wicked shall perish. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Why do the nations rage, 
</p><p class="q2">and the peoples plot a vain thing? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>The kings of the earth take a stand, 
</p><p class="q2">and the rulers take counsel together, 
</p><p class="q2">against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,<span class="f">+ \fr 2:2 \ft The word “Anointed” is the same as the word for “Messiah” or “Christ”</span> saying, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>“Let’s break their bonds apart, 
</p><p class="q2">and cast their cords from us.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>He who sits in the heavens will laugh. 
</p><p class="q2">The Lord<span class="f">+ \fr 2:4 \ft The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span> will have them in derision. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Then he will speak to them in his anger, 
</p><p class="q2">and terrify them in his wrath: 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“Yet I have set my King on my set-apart hill of Zion.” 
</p><p class="q2">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>I will tell of the decree: 
</p><p class="q1">Yahweh said to me, “You are my son. 
</p><p class="q2">Today I have become your father. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, 
</p><p class="q2">the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You shall break them with a rod of iron. 
</p><p class="q2">You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Now therefore be wise, you kings. 
</p><p class="q2">Be instructed, you judges of the earth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Serve Yahweh with fear, 
</p><p class="q2">and rejoice with trembling. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Give sincere homage to the Son,<span class="f">+ \fr 2:12 \ft or, Kiss the son</span> lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, 
</p><p class="q2">for his wrath will soon be kindled. 
</p><p class="q2">Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

<p class="d">A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.

<span class="v">4&#160;</span>I cry to Yahweh with my voice, 
</p><p class="q2">and he answers me out of his set-apart hill. </p><p class="qs">Selah.</p> 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>I laid myself down and slept. 
</p><p class="q2">I awakened, for Yahweh sustains me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people 
</p><p class="q2">who have set themselves against me on every side. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Arise, Yahweh! 
</p><p class="q2">Save me, my Elohim! 
</p><p class="q1">For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.

<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Salvation belongs to Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q2">May your blessing be on your people. </p><p class="qs">Selah.</p>

</p><p class="q2">Give me relief from my distress. 
</p><p class="q2">Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? 
</p><p class="q2">Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? </p><p class="qs">Selah.</p> 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is elohimly; 
</p><p class="q2">Yahweh will hear when I call to him. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Stand in awe, and don’t sin. 
</p><p class="q2">Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. </p><p class="qs">Selah.</p> 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. 
</p><p class="q2">Put your trust in Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Many say, “Who will show us any good?” 
</p><p class="q2">Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>You have put gladness in my heart, 
</p><p class="q2">more than when their grain and their new wine are increased. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, 
</p><p class="q2">for you alone, Yahweh, make me live in safety. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<p class="d">For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Give ear to my words, Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q2">Consider my meditation. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">for I pray to you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. 
</p><p class="q2">In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>For you are not an Elohim who has pleasure in wickedness. 
</p><p class="q2">Evil can’t live with you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The arrogant will not stand in your sight. 
</p><p class="q2">You hate all workers of iniquity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>You will destroy those who speak lies. 
</p><p class="q2">Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. 
</p><p class="q2">I will bow toward your set-apart temple in reverence of you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. 
</p><p class="q2">Make your way straight before my face. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. 
</p><p class="q2">Their heart is destruction. 
</p><p class="q2">Their throat is an open tomb. 
</p><p class="q2">They flatter with their tongue. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Hold them guilty, Elohim. 
</p><p class="q2">Let them fall by their own counsels. 
</p><p class="q1">Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, 
</p><p class="q2">for they have rebelled against you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice. 
</p><p class="q2">Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. 
</p><p class="q1">Let them also who love your name be joyful in you. 
</p><p class="q2">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>For you will bless the righteous. 
</p><p class="q1">Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.

<p class="d">For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger,

<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, 
</p><p class="q2">and save me for your loving kindness’ sake. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>For in death there is no memory of you. 
</p><p class="q2">In Sheol,<span class="f">+ \fr 6:5 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.</span> who shall give you thanks? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>I am weary with my groaning. 
</p><p class="q2">Every night I flood my bed. 
</p><p class="q2">I drench my couch with my tears.

<span class="v">7&#160;</span>My eye wastes away because of grief.

</p><p class="q2">They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.

<p class="d">A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Yahweh, my Elohim, I take refuge in you.

<span class="v">12&#160;</span>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,

<span class="v">24&#160;</span>He rained down manna on them to eat,

<span class="v">46&#160;</span>He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">50&#160;</span>He made a path for his anger.

<span class="v">51&#160;</span>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,

<span class="v">52&#160;</span>But he led out his own people like sheep,

<span class="v">53&#160;</span>He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, 
</p><p class="q2">but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">54&#160;</span>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">55&#160;</span>He also drove out the nations before them, 
</p><p class="q2">allotted them for an inheritance by line, 
</p><p class="q2">and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">56&#160;</span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">and didn’t keep his testimonies,

<span class="v">57&#160;</span>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">59&#160;</span>When Elohim heard this, he was angry, 
</p><p class="q2">and greatly abhorred Israel,

<span class="v">61&#160;</span>and delivered his strength into captivity,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">62&#160;</span>He also gave his people over to the sword,

<span class="v">63&#160;</span>Fire devoured their young men.

<span class="v">64&#160;</span>Their priests fell by the sword,

<span class="v">65&#160;</span>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, 
</p><p class="q2">like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">66&#160;</span>He struck his adversaries backward. 
</p><p class="q2">He put them to a perpetual reproach. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">67&#160;</span>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, 
</p><p class="q2">and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,

<span class="v">68&#160;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah,

<span class="v">69&#160;</span>He built his sanctuary like the heights, 
</p><p class="q2">like the earth which he has established forever. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">70&#160;</span>He also chose David his servant,

<span class="v">71&#160;</span>from following the ewes that have their young,
