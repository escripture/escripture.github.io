<div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, 
</div><div class="q2">nor stand on the path of sinners, 
</div><div class="q2">nor sit in the seat of scoffers; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>but his delight is in Yahweh’s law. 
</div><div class="q2">On his law he meditates day and night. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, 
</div><div class="q2">that produces its fruit in its season, 
</div><div class="q2">whose leaf also does not wither. 
</div><div class="q2">Whatever he does shall prosper. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The wicked are not so, 
</div><div class="q2">but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, 
</div><div class="q2">nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, 
</div><div class="q2">but the way of the wicked shall perish. 
</div><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Why do the nations rage, 
</div><div class="q2">and the peoples plot a vain thing? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The kings of the earth take a stand, 
</div><div class="q2">and the rulers take counsel together, 
</div><div class="q2">against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>“Let’s break their bonds apart, 
</div><div class="q2">and cast their cords from us.” 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He who sits in the heavens will laugh. 
</div><div class="q2">The Lord will have them in derision. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then he will speak to them in his anger, 
</div><div class="q2">and terrify them in his wrath: 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“Yet I have set my King on my set-apart hill of Zion.” 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I will tell of the decree: 
</div><div class="q1">Yahweh said to me, “You are my son. 
</div><div class="q2">Today I have become your father. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, 
</div><div class="q2">the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>You shall break them with a rod of iron. 
</div><div class="q2">You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Now therefore be wise, you kings. 
</div><div class="q2">Be instructed, you judges of the earth. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Serve Yahweh with fear, 
</div><div class="q2">and rejoice with trembling. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, 
</div><div class="q2">for his wrath will soon be kindled. 
</div><div class="q2">Blessed are all those who take refuge in him. 
</div><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="d">A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! 
</div><div class="q2">Many are those who rise up against me. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Many there are who say of my soul, 
</div><div class="q2">“There is no help for him in Elohim.” </div><div class="qs">Selah. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, 
</div><div class="q2">my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I cry to Yahweh with my voice, 
</div><div class="q2">and he answers me out of his set-apart hill. </div><div class="qs">Selah. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>I laid myself down and slept. 
</div><div class="q2">I awakened, for Yahweh sustains me. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people 
</div><div class="q2">who have set themselves against me on every side. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Arise, Yahweh! 
</div><div class="q2">Save me, my Elohim! 
</div><div class="q1">For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. 
</div><div class="q2">You have broken the teeth of the wicked. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Salvation belongs to Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q2">May your blessing be on your people. </div><div class="qs">Selah. 
</div><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="d">For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Answer me when I call, Elohim of my righteousness. 
</div><div class="q2">Give me relief from my distress. 
</div><div class="q2">Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? 
</div><div class="q2">Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? </div><div class="qs">Selah. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is elohimly; 
</div><div class="q2">Yahweh will hear when I call to him. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Stand in awe, and don’t sin. 
</div><div class="q2">Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. </div><div class="qs">Selah. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. 
</div><div class="q2">Put your trust in Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Many say, “Who will show us any good?” 
</div><div class="q2">Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>You have put gladness in my heart, 
</div><div class="q2">more than when their grain and their new wine are increased. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, 
</div><div class="q2">for you alone, Yahweh, make me live in safety. 
</div><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<div class="d">For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Give ear to my words, Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q2">Consider my meditation. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my Elohim, 
</div><div class="q2">for I pray to you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. 
</div><div class="q2">In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For you are not an Elohim who has pleasure in wickedness. 
</div><div class="q2">Evil can’t live with you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The arrogant will not stand in your sight. 
</div><div class="q2">You hate all workers of iniquity. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>You will destroy those who speak lies. 
</div><div class="q2">Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. 
</div><div class="q2">I will bow toward your set-apart temple in reverence of you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. 
</div><div class="q2">Make your way straight before my face. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. 
</div><div class="q2">Their heart is destruction. 
</div><div class="q2">Their throat is an open tomb. 
</div><div class="q2">They flatter with their tongue. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Hold them guilty, Elohim. 
</div><div class="q2">Let them fall by their own counsels. 
</div><div class="q1">Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, 
</div><div class="q2">for they have rebelled against you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice. 
</div><div class="q2">Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. 
</div><div class="q1">Let them also who love your name be joyful in you. 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>For you will bless the righteous. 
</div><div class="q1">Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield. 
</div><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<div class="d">For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger, 
</div><div class="q2">neither discipline me in your wrath. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. 
</div><div class="q2">Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>My soul is also in great anguish. 
</div><div class="q2">But you, Yahweh—how long? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, 
</div><div class="q2">and save me for your loving kindness’ sake. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>For in death there is no memory of you. 
</div><div class="q2">In Sheol, who shall give you thanks? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>I am weary with my groaning. 
</div><div class="q2">Every night I flood my bed. 
</div><div class="q2">I drench my couch with my tears. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>My eye wastes away because of grief. 
</div><div class="q2">It grows old because of all my adversaries. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, 
</div><div class="q2">for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.

<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yahweh has heard my supplication. 
</div><div class="q2">Yahweh accepts my prayer.

<sup>10&#160;</sup>May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. 
</div><div class="q2">They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.

<div class="d">A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.

<sup>32&#160;</sup>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,
