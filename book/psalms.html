<h2 class="ms1">BOOK 1</h2>
<h2 class="psalmlabel" id="1">1</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, 
</p><p class="q2">nor stand on the path of sinners, 
</p><p class="q2">nor sit in the seat of scoffers; 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>but his delight is in Yahuah’s law. 
</p><p class="q2">On his law he meditates day and night. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, 
</p><p class="q2">that produces its fruit in its season, 
</p><p class="q2">whose leaf also does not wither. 
</p><p class="q2">Whatever he does shall prosper. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The wicked are not so, 
</p><p class="q2">but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, 
</p><p class="q2">nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>For Yahuah knows the way of the righteous, 
</p><p class="q2">but the way of the wicked shall perish. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Why do the nations rage, 
</p><p class="q2">and the peoples plot a vain thing? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The kings of the earth take a stand, 
</p><p class="q2">and the rulers take counsel together, 
</p><p class="q2">against Yahuah, and against his Anointed, saying, 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>“Let’s break their bonds apart, 
</p><p class="q2">and cast their cords from us.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He who sits in the heavens will laugh. 
</p><p class="q2">The Lord will have them in derision. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then he will speak to them in his anger, 
</p><p class="q2">and terrify them in his wrath: 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“Yet I have set my King on my set-apart hill of Zion.” 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I will tell of the decree: 
</p><p class="q1">Yahuah said to me, “You are my son. 
</p><p class="q2">Today I have become your father. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, 
</p><p class="q2">the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>You shall break them with a rod of iron. 
</p><p class="q2">You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Now therefore be wise, you kings. 
</p><p class="q2">Be instructed, you judges of the earth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Serve Yahuah with fear, 
</p><p class="q2">and rejoice with trembling. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, 
</p><p class="q2">for his wrath will soon be kindled. 
</p><p class="q2">Blessed are all those who take refuge in him. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p class="d">A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah, how my adversaries have increased! 
</p><p class="q2">Many are those who rise up against me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Many there are who say of my soul, 
</p><p class="q2">“There is no help for him in Elohim.” </p><p class="qs">Selah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>But you, Yahuah, are a shield around me, 
</p><p class="q2">my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I cry to Yahuah with my voice, 
</p><p class="q2">and he answers me out of his set-apart hill. </p><p class="qs">Selah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>I laid myself down and slept. 
</p><p class="q2">I awakened, for Yahuah sustains me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people 
</p><p class="q2">who have set themselves against me on every side. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Arise, Yahuah! 
</p><p class="q2">Save me, my Elohim! 
</p><p class="q1">For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. 
</p><p class="q2">You have broken the teeth of the wicked. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Salvation belongs to Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q2">May your blessing be on your people. </p><p class="qs">Selah. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p class="d">For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Answer me when I call, Elohim of my righteousness. 
</p><p class="q2">Give me relief from my distress. 
</p><p class="q2">Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? 
</p><p class="q2">Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? </p><p class="qs">Selah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>But know that Yahuah has set apart for himself him who is elohimly; 
</p><p class="q2">Yahuah will hear when I call to him. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Stand in awe, and don’t sin. 
</p><p class="q2">Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. </p><p class="qs">Selah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. 
</p><p class="q2">Put your trust in Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Many say, “Who will show us any good?” 
</p><p class="q2">Yahuah, let the light of your face shine on us. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>You have put gladness in my heart, 
</p><p class="q2">more than when their grain and their new wine are increased. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, 
</p><p class="q2">for you alone, Yahuah, make me live in safety. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<p class="d">For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Give ear to my words, Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q2">Consider my meditation. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">for I pray to you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahuah, in the morning you will hear my voice. 
</p><p class="q2">In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For you are not an Elohim who has pleasure in wickedness. 
</p><p class="q2">Evil can’t live with you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The arrogant will not stand in your sight. 
</p><p class="q2">You hate all workers of iniquity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>You will destroy those who speak lies. 
</p><p class="q2">Yahuah abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. 
</p><p class="q2">I will bow toward your set-apart temple in reverence of you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Lead me, Yahuah, in your righteousness because of my enemies. 
</p><p class="q2">Make your way straight before my face. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. 
</p><p class="q2">Their heart is destruction. 
</p><p class="q2">Their throat is an open tomb. 
</p><p class="q2">They flatter with their tongue. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Hold them guilty, Elohim. 
</p><p class="q2">Let them fall by their own counsels. 
</p><p class="q1">Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, 
</p><p class="q2">for they have rebelled against you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice. 
</p><p class="q2">Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. 
</p><p class="q1">Let them also who love your name be joyful in you. 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>For you will bless the righteous. 
</p><p class="q1">Yahuah, you will surround him with favor as with a shield. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<p class="d">For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah, don’t rebuke me in your anger, 
</p><p class="q2">neither discipline me in your wrath. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Have mercy on me, Yahuah, for I am faint. 
</p><p class="q2">Yahuah, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>My soul is also in great anguish. 
</p><p class="q2">But you, Yahuah—how long? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Return, Yahuah. Deliver my soul, 
</p><p class="q2">and save me for your loving kindness’ sake. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>For in death there is no memory of you. 
</p><p class="q2">In Sheol, who shall give you thanks? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>I am weary with my groaning. 
</p><p class="q2">Every night I flood my bed. 
</p><p class="q2">I drench my couch with my tears. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>My eye wastes away because of grief. 
</p><p class="q2">It grows old because of all my adversaries. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, 
</p><p class="q2">for Yahuah has heard the voice of my weeping. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yahuah has heard my supplication. 
</p><p class="q2">Yahuah accepts my prayer. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. 
</p><p class="q2">They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="7">7</h2>
<p class="d">A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahuah, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah, my Elohim, I take refuge in you. 
</p><p class="q2">Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me, 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, 
</p><p class="q2">ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahuah, my Elohim, if I have done this, 
</p><p class="q2">if there is iniquity in my hands, 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me 
</p><p class="q2">(yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary), 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; 
</p><p class="q1">yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, 
</p><p class="q2">and lay my glory in the dust. </p><p class="qs">Selah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Arise, Yahuah, in your anger. 
</p><p class="q2">Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. 
</p><p class="q1">Awake for me. You have commanded judgment. 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. 
</p><p class="q2">Rule over them on high. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Yahuah administers judgment to the peoples. 
</p><p class="q2">Judge me, Yahuah, according to my righteousness, 
</p><p class="q2">and to my integrity that is in me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, 
</p><p class="q2">but establish the righteous; 
</p><p class="q2">their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous Elohim. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>My shield is with Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">who saves the upright in heart. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Elohim is a righteous judge, 
</p><p class="q2">yes, an Elohim who has indignation every day. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword; 
</p><p class="q2">he has bent and strung his bow. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. 
</p><p class="q2">He makes ready his flaming arrows. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Behold, he travails with iniquity. 
</p><p class="q2">Yes, he has conceived mischief, 
</p><p class="q2">and brought out falsehood. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He has dug a hole, 
</p><p class="q2">and has fallen into the pit which he made. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. 
</p><p class="q2">His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>I will give thanks to Yahuah according to his righteousness, 
</p><p class="q2">and will sing praise to the name of Yahuah Most High. 
</p><h2 class="psalmlabel" id="8">8</h2>
<p class="d">For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! 
</p><p class="q2">You have set your glory above the heavens! 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, 
</p><p class="q2">because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Surely Elohim is good to Israel, 
</p><p class="q2">to those who are pure in heart. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>But as for me, my feet were almost gone. 
</p><p class="q2">My steps had nearly slipped. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For I was envious of the arrogant, 
</p><p class="q2">when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For there are no struggles in their death,

</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>They are free from burdens of men, 
</p><p class="q2">neither are they plagued like other men. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. 
</p><p class="q2">Violence covers them like a garment. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Their eyes bulge with fat. 
</p><p class="q2">Their minds pass the limits of conceit. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>They scoff and speak with malice. 
</p><p class="q2">In arrogance, they threaten oppression. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>They have set their mouth in the heavens.

<sup>10&#160;</sup>Therefore their people return to them,

<sup>14&#160;</sup>For all day long I have been plagued, 
</p><p class="q2">and punished every morning.

<sup>19&#160;</sup>How they are suddenly destroyed! 
</p><p class="q2">They are completely swept away with terrors.

<sup>20&#160;</sup>As a dream when one wakes up, 
</p><p class="q2">so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.

<sup>22&#160;</sup>I was so senseless and ignorant. 
</p><p class="q2">I was a brute beast before you.

<sup>23&#160;</sup>Nevertheless, I am continually with you. 
</p><p class="q2">You have held my right hand.

<sup>26&#160;</sup>He sent Moses, his servant,

<sup>27&#160;</sup>They performed miracles among them,

<sup>9&#160;</sup>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;

<sup>11&#160;</sup>The waters covered their adversaries.

</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>They soon forgot his works. 
</p><p class="q2">They didn’t wait for his counsel,

<sup>14&#160;</sup>but gave in to craving in the desert, 
</p><p class="q2">and tested Elohim in the wasteland. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He gave them their request, 
</p><p class="q2">but sent leanness into their soul. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>They envied Moses also in the camp,

</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,

<sup>18&#160;</sup>A fire was kindled in their company. 
</p><p class="q2">The flame burned up the wicked. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>They made a calf in Horeb,

<sup>20&#160;</sup>Thus they exchanged their glory 
</p><p class="q2">for an image of a bull that eats grass. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>They forgot Elohim, their Savior, 
</p><p class="q2">who had done great things in Egypt, 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>wondrous works in the land of Ham, 
</p><p class="q2">and awesome things by the Red Sea. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Therefore he said that he would destroy them,

</p><p class="q2">to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Yes, they despised the pleasant land. 
</p><p class="q2">They didn’t believe his word, 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>but murmured in their tents, 
</p><p class="q2">and didn’t listen to Yahuah’s voice. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Therefore he swore to them

<sup>27&#160;</sup>that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, 
</p><p class="q2">and scatter them in the lands. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, 
</p><p class="q2">and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. 
</p><p class="q2">The plague broke in on them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, 
</p><p class="q2">so the plague was stopped. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>That was credited to him for righteousness, 
</p><p class="q2">for all generations to come. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, 
</p><p class="q2">so that Moses was troubled for their sakes; 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>because they were rebellious against his spirit, 
</p><p class="q2">he spoke rashly with his lips. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>They didn’t destroy the peoples, 
</p><p class="q2">as Yahuah commanded them,

<sup>35&#160;</sup>but mixed themselves with the nations, 
</p><p class="q2">and learned their works. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>36&#160;</sup>They served their idols, 
</p><p class="q2">which became a snare to them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>37&#160;</sup>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>38&#160;</sup>They shed innocent blood, 
</p><p class="q2">even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, 
</p><p class="q2">whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. 
</p><p class="q2">The land was polluted with blood. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>39&#160;</sup>Thus they were defiled with their works, 
</p><p class="q2">and prostituted themselves in their deeds. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>40&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahuah burned with anger against his people. 
</p><p class="q2">He abhorred his inheritance. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>41&#160;</sup>He gave them into the hand of the nations. 
</p><p class="q2">Those who hated them ruled over them.
