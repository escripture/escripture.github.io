<span class="v">9&#160;</span>and he lived eastward even to the entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their livestock were multiplied in the land of Gilead. 
</p><p>

<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of their fathers’ houses. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>They lived in Gilead in Bashan and in its towns, and in all the pasture lands of Sharon as far as their borders.

<span class="v">18&#160;</span>The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, able to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were forty-four thousand seven hundred sixty that were able to go out to war. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>They made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>They were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with them; for they cried to Elohim in the battle, and he answered them because they put their trust in him. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>They took away their livestock: of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand, and of donkeys two thousand, and of men one hundred thousand. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>For many fell slain, because the war was of Elohim. They lived in their place until the captivity. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>The children of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land. They increased from Bashan to Baal Hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel—mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their fathers’ houses. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>They trespassed against the Elohim of their fathers, and played the prostitute after the elohims of the peoples of the land whom Elohim destroyed before them. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>So the Elohim of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried away the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

<span class="v">39&#160;</span>The sons of Eshek his brother: Ulam his firstborn, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third. 
<span class="v">40&#160;</span>The sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor, archers, and had many sons, and grandsons, one hundred fifty. All these were of the sons of Benjamin.

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>So all Israel were listed by genealogies; and behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 9:1 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>In Jerusalem, there lived of the children of Judah, of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh: 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Of the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their brothers, six hundred ninety. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah;

<span class="v">9&#160;</span>and their brothers, according to their generations, nine hundred fifty-six. All these men were heads of fathers’ households by their fathers’ houses. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Of the priests: Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>and Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of Elohim’s house;

<span class="v">13&#160;</span>and their brothers, heads of their fathers’ houses, one thousand seven hundred sixty; they were very able men for the work of the service of Elohim’s house. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>and Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brothers (Shallum was the chief), 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>who previously served in the king’s gate eastward. They were the gatekeepers for the camp of the children of Levi. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Shallum was the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his father’s house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent. Their fathers had been over Yehovah’s camp, keepers of the entry. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, and Yehovah was with him. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper of the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>All these who were chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds were two hundred twelve. These were listed by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of Yehovah’s house, even the house of the tent, as guards. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>On the four sides were the gatekeepers, toward the east, west, north, and south. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Their brothers, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them, 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in Elohim’s house. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>They stayed around Elohim’s house, because that was their duty; and it was their duty to open it morning by morning. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Certain of them were in charge of the vessels of service, for these were brought in by count, and these were taken out by count. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense, and the spices. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Some of the sons of the priests prepared the mixing of the spices. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust over the things that were baked in pans. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Some of their brothers, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every Sabbath. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>These are the singers, heads of fathers’ households of the Levites, who lived in the rooms and were free from other service, for they were employed in their work day and night. 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>These were heads of fathers’ households of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men. They lived at Jerusalem. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">35&#160;</span>Jeiel the father of Gibeon, whose woman’s name was Maacah, lived in Gibeon. 
<span class="v">36&#160;</span>His firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 
<span class="v">37&#160;</span>Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
<span class="v">38&#160;</span>Mikloth brought forth Shimeam. They also lived with their relatives in Jerusalem, near their relatives. 
<span class="v">39&#160;</span>Ner brought forth Kish. Kish brought forth Saul. Saul brought forth Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 
<span class="v">40&#160;</span>The son of Jonathan was Merib-baal. Merib-baal brought forth Micah. 
<span class="v">41&#160;</span>The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. 
<span class="v">42&#160;</span>Ahaz brought forth Jarah. Jarah brought forth Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. Zimri brought forth Moza. 
<span class="v">43&#160;</span>Moza brought forth Binea, Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel his son. 
<span class="v">44&#160;</span>Azel had six sons, whose names are Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.” 
</p><p>But his armor bearer would not, for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword and fell on it. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>So Saul died with his three sons; and all his house died together. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>They stripped him and took his head and his armor, then sent into the land of the Philistines all around to carry the news to their idols and to the people. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>They put his armor in the house of their elohims, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yehovah, because of Yehovah’s word, which he didn’t keep, and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire, 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>and didn’t inquire of Yehovah. Therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="11">11</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yehovah your Elohim said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yehovah. They anointed David king over Israel, according to Yehovah’s word by Samuel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here!” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is David’s city. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>David had said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>David grew greater and greater, for Yehovah of Armies was with him. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yehovah’s word concerning Israel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yehovah saved them by a great victory. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>David longed, and said, “Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to Yehovah, 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>and said, “My Elohim forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the three. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits<span class="f">+ \fr 11:23 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters. Therefore this Egyptian was bout 7 feet and 6 inches or 2.28 meters tall.</span> high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things and had a name among the three mighty men. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his guard. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>The mighty men of the armies also include Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="12">12</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish. They were among the mighty men, his helpers in war. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of Benjamin. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite; 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite; 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains: 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army. He who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the Elohim of our fathers see this and rebuke it.” 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your Elohim helps you.” Then David received them and made them captains of the band. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Some of Manasseh also joined David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they didn’t help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>As he went to Ziklag, some from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were captains in the army. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like Elohim’s army. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to Yehovah’s word. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred, armed for war. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war: seven thousand one hundred. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Of the children of Levi: four thousand six hundred. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand seven hundred, 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Of the children of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives: three thousand, for until then, the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Saul’s house. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Of the children of Ephraim: twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers’ houses. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>Of the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command. 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array with all kinds of instruments of war: fifty thousand who could command and were not of double heart. 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>Of Naphtali: one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand. 
<span class="v">35&#160;</span>Of the Danites who could set the battle in array: twenty-eight thousand six hundred. 
<span class="v">36&#160;</span>Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array: forty thousand. 
<span class="v">37&#160;</span>On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle: one hundred twenty thousand. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">38&#160;</span>All these were men of war who could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. 
<span class="v">39&#160;</span>They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them. 
<span class="v">40&#160;</span>Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="13">13</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yehovah our Elohim, let’s send word everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have pasture lands, that they may gather themselves to us. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Also, let’s bring the ark of our Elohim back to us again, for we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>All the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor River of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring Elohim’s ark from Kiriath Jearim. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there Elohim Yehovah’s ark that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>They carried Elohim’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>David and all Israel played before Elohim with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Yehovah’s anger burned against Uzza, and he struck him because he put his hand on the ark; and he died there before Elohim. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>David was displeased, because Yehovah had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>David was afraid of Elohim that day, saying, “How can I bring Elohim’s ark home to me?” 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>So David didn’t move the ark with him into David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Elohim’s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months; and Yehovah blessed Obed-Edom’s house and all that he had. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="14">14</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>David perceived that Yehovah had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, for his people Israel’s sake. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>David took more women in Jerusalem, and David brought forth more sons and daughters. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>David inquired of Elohim, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” 
</p><p>Yehovah said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, Elohim has broken my enemies by my hand, like waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.<span class="f">+ \fr 14:11 \ft “Baal Perazim” means “The Lord who breaks out”.</span> 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>They left their elohims there; and David gave a command, and they were burned with fire. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>The Philistines made another raid in the valley. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>David inquired again of Elohim; and Elohim said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for Elohim has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>David did as Elohim commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yehovah brought the fear of him on all nations. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="15">15</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>David made himself houses in David’s city; and he prepared a place for Elohim’s ark, and pitched a tent for it. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Then David said, “No one ought to carry Elohim’s ark but the Levites. For Yehovah has chosen them to carry Elohim’s ark, and to minister to him forever.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yehovah’s ark to its place, which he had prepared for it. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty; 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty; 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty; 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred; 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty; 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yehovah our Elohim broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek him according to the ordinance.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>The children of the Levites bore Elohim’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yehovah’s word. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>and with them their brothers of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud; 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth; 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skillful. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before Elohim’s ark; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring the ark of Yehovah’s covenant up out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>When Elohim helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yehovah’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yehovah’s covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>As the ark of Yehovah’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="16">16</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>They brought in Elohim’s ark, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Elohim. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in Yehovah’s name. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>He gave to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>He appointed some of the Levites to minister before Yehovah’s ark, and to commemorate, to thank, and to praise Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel: 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of Elohim. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Then on that day David first ordained giving of thanks to Yehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>When David was living in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I live in a cedar house, but the ark of Yehovah’s covenant is in a tent.”

</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>That same night, the word of Elohim came to Nathan, saying, 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>“Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yehovah says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in; 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’&#160;”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>“Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yehovah of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yehovah will build you a house. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you; 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever.”&#160;’&#160;” 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Then David the king went in and sat before Yehovah; and he said, “Who am I, Yehovah Elohim, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far? 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>This was a small thing in your eyes, O Elohim, but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, Yehovah Elohim. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Yehovah, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Yehovah, there is no one like you, neither is there any Elohim besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom Elohim went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people whom you redeemed out of Egypt? 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yehovah, became their Elohim. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Now, Yehovah, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yehovah of Armies is the Elohim of Israel, even an Elohim to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’ 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>For you, my Elohim, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Now, Yehovah, you are Elohim, and have promised this good thing to your servant. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>He defeated Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, toward Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. Yehovah gave victory to David wherever he went. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze.

<span class="v">9&#160;</span>When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>King David also dedicated these to Yehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations: from Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt.

</p><p>So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?” 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”

<span class="v">6&#160;</span>When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents<span class="f">+ \fr 19:6 \ft A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds, so 1000 talents is about 30 metric tons</span> of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.

<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people and for the cities of our Elohim. May Yehovah do that which seems good to him.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and called out the Syrians who were beyond the River,<span class="f">+ \fr 19:16 \ft or, the Euphrates River</span> with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>David was told that, so he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand footmen, and also killed Shophach the captain of the army. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold,<span class="f">+ \fr 20:2 \ft A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces</span> and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="21">21</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Joab said, “May Yehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Elohim was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>David said to Elohim, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Yehovah spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yehovah says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>So Gad came to David and said to him, “Yehovah says, ‘Take your choice: 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of Yehovah, even pestilence in the land, and Yehovah’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yehovah’s hand, for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>So Yehovah sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Elohim sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yehovah saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yehovah’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yehovah’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. 
</p><p>Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>David said to Elohim, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yehovah my Elohim, be against me and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Then Yehovah’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yehovah on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yehovah’s name. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yehovah on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yehovah, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels<span class="f">+ \fr 21:25 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.32 Troy ounces, so 600 shekels was about 6 kilograms or about 192 Troy ounces.</span> of gold by weight for the place. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>David built an altar to Yehovah there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yehovah; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Then Yehovah commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>At that time, when David saw that Yehovah had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>For Yehovah’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of Elohim, for he was afraid because of the sword of Yehovah’s angel. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="22">22</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Then David said, “This is the house of Yehovah Elohim, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build Elohim’s house. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings, and bronze in abundance without weight, 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yehovah must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yehovah my Elohim. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>But Yehovah’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Now, my son, may Yehovah be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yehovah your Elohim, as he has spoken concerning you. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>May Yehovah give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel, so that you may keep the law of Yehovah your Elohim. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yehovah gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid and don’t be dismayed. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yehovah’s house one hundred thousand talents<span class="f">+ \fr 22:14 \ft A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 100,000 talents is about 3 metric tons</span> of gold, one million talents<span class="f">+ \fr 22:14 \ft about 30,000 metric tons</span> of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>There are also workmen with you in abundance—cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work; 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yehovah be with you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>“Isn’t Yehovah your Elohim with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yehovah and before his people. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yehovah your Elohim. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yehovah Elohim, to bring the ark of Yehovah’s covenant and the set-apart vessels of Elohim into the house that is to be built for Yehovah’s name.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="23">23</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yehovah’s house, six thousand were officers and judges, 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised Yehovah with the instruments which I made for giving praise.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most set-apart things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before Yehovah, to minister to him, and to bless in his name forever. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>But as for Moses the man of Elohim, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>The son of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only; and their relatives, the sons of Kish, took them as women. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yehovah’s house, from twenty years old and upward. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>For David said, “Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.” 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>For their duty was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yehovah’s house—in the courts, in the rooms, and in the purifying of all set-apart things, even the work of the service of Elohim’s house; 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size; 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yehovah, and likewise in the evening; 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>and to offer all burnt offerings to Yehovah on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yehovah; 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the set-apart place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of Yehovah’s house. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="24">24</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Thus they were divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of Elohim, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>This was their ordering in their service, to come into Yehovah’s house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel, had commanded him. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>The sons of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>The brother of Micah: Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>The sons of Merari by Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Of Kish, the son of Kish: Jerahmeel. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers’ houses. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites, the fathers’ households of the chief even as those of his younger brother. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="25">25</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals. The number of those who did the work according to their service was: 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. The sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied at the order of the king. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yehovah with the harp. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of Elohim, to lift up the horn. Elohim gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>All these were under the hands of their father for song in Yehovah’s house, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of Elohim’s house: Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yehovah, even all who were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>They cast lots for their offices, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Now the first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah, he and his brothers and sons were twelve; 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve;

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; for Elohim blessed him. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Sons were also born to Shemaiah his son, who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose relatives were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom with their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the service: sixty-two of Obed-Edom. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, eighteen valiant men. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief), 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in Yehovah’s house. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers’ houses, for every gate. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watchman opposite watchman. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of Elohim’s house and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

<span class="v">25&#160;</span>His brothers: of Eliezer, Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers’ households, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to repair Yehovah’s house. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>All that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth and of his brothers. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were appointed to the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, one thousand seven hundred men of valor, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yehovah and for the service of the king. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>Of the Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers’ households. They were sought for in the fortieth year of the reign of David, and mighty men of valor were found among them at Jazer of Gilead. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>His relatives, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers’ households, whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to Elohim and for the affairs of the king.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Now the children of Israel after their number, the heads of fathers’ households and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year—of every division were twenty-four thousand. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>He was of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the army for the first month.

<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the chief priest. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>This is that Benaiah who was the mighty man of the thirty and over the thirty. Of his division was Ammizabad his son. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him. In his division were twenty-four thousand.

<span class="v">22&#160;</span>of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>But David didn’t take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yehovah had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Joab the son of Zeruiah began to take a census, but didn’t finish; and wrath came on Israel for this. The number wasn’t put into the account in the chronicles of King David. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel. Over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers was Jonathan the son of Uzziah;

<span class="v">31&#160;</span>All these were the rulers of the property which was King David’s. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Also Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe. Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons. 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>Ahithophel was the king’s counselor. Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend. 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was the captain of the king’s army. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="28">28</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who served the king by division, the captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Then David the king stood up on his feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of Yehovah’s covenant, and for the footstool of our Elohim; and I had prepared for the building. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>But Elohim said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’ 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>However Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Of all my sons (for Yehovah has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yehovah’s kingdom over Israel. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as it is today.’ 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, Yehovah’s assembly, and in the audience of our Elohim, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yehovah your Elohim, that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You, Solomon my son, know the Elohim of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yehovah searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Take heed now, for Yehovah has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans for the porch of the temple, for its houses, for its treasuries, for its upper rooms, for its inner rooms, for the place of the mercy seat; 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>and the plans of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of Yehovah’s house, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of Elohim’s house, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things; 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of Yehovah’s house, and for all the vessels of service in Yehovah’s house—<span class="v">14&#160;</span>of gold by weight for the gold for all vessels of every kind of service, for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>by weight also for the lamp stands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps; and for the lamp stands of silver, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lamp stand; 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>and the forks, the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>and for the altar of incense, refined gold by weight; and gold for the plans for the chariot, and the cherubim that spread out and cover the ark of Yehovah’s covenant. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>“All this”, David said, “I have been made to understand in writing from Yehovah’s hand, even all the works of this pattern.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed, for Yehovah Elohim, even my Elohim, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of Yehovah’s house is finished. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of Elohim’s house. Every willing man who has skill for any kind of service shall be with you in all kinds of work. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="29">29</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone Elohim has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yehovah Elohim. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my Elohim the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, also onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my Elohim, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my Elohim, over and above all that I have prepared for the set-apart house: 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>even three thousand talents of gold,<span class="f">+ \fr 29:4 \ft A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 3000 talents is about 90 metric tons</span> of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents<span class="f">+ \fr 29:4 \ft about 210 metric tons</span> of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses; 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself today to Yehovah?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly; 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>and they gave for the service of Elohim’s house of gold five thousand talents<span class="f">+ \fr 29:7 \ft A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 5000 talents is about 150 metric tons</span> and ten thousand darics,<span class="f">+ \fr 29:7 \ft a daric was a gold coin issued by a Persian king, weighing about 8.4 grams or about 0.27 troy ounces each.</span> of silver ten thousand talents, of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yehovah’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yehovah; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Therefore David blessed Yehovah before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed, Yehovah, the Elohim of Israel our father, forever and ever. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Yours, Yehovah, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yehovah, and you are exalted as head above all. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all! 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Now therefore, our Elohim, we thank you and praise your glorious name. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your own. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>For we are strangers before you and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Yehovah our Elohim, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your set-apart name comes from your hand, and is all your own. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>I know also, my Elohim, that you try the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Yehovah, the Elohim of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you; 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless Yehovah your Elohim!” 
</p><p>All the assembly blessed Yehovah, the Elohim of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yehovah and the king. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>They sacrificed sacrifices to Yehovah and offered burnt offerings to Yehovah on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel, 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>and ate and drank before Yehovah on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Yehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Yehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>with all his reign and his might, and the events that involved him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the lands. </p></div></body></html>
