Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For it is better, if it is Elohim’s will, that you suffer for doing what is right than for doing evil.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to Elohim, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> in whom he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> who before were disobedient when Elohim waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward Elohim—through the resurrection of Yehoshua Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> who is at the right hand of Elohim, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him. </div>

On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men’s matters.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify Elohim in this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of Elohim. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who don’t obey the Good News of Elohim?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the unelohimly and the sinner?”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Proverbs 11:31</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of Elohim in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator. </div>
