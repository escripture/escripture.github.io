<sup>8&#160;</sup>So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.

<sup>12&#160;</sup>He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the altar. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar; 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver; 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the people.

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.

<sup>10&#160;</sup>You are to make a distinction between the set-apart and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘When a man consecrates a person to Yahweh in a vow, according to your valuation, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>your valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel<span class="f">+ \fr 27:3 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.</span> of the sanctuary. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>If she is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>If the person is from five years old to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>If the person is from a month old to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall assign a value to him. The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.
