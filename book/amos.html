<sup>1&#160;</sup>The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>He said: 
</div><div class="q1">“Yahweh will roar from Zion, 
</div><div class="q2">and utter his voice from Jerusalem; 
</div><div class="q1">and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn, 
</div><div class="q2">and the top of Carmel will wither.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of Damascus, yes, for four, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not turn away its punishment, 
</div><div class="q2">because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, 
</div><div class="q2">and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>I will break the bar of Damascus, 
</div><div class="q2">and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, 
</div><div class="q2">and him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden; 
</div><div class="q2">and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir,” 
</div><div class="p">says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not turn away its punishment, 
</div><div class="q2">because they carried away captive the whole community, 
</div><div class="q2">to deliver them up to Edom; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, 
</div><div class="q2">and it will devour its palaces.

<sup>8&#160;</sup>I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, 
</div><div class="q2">and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; 
</div><div class="q1">and I will turn my hand against Ekron; 
</div><div class="q2">and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,” 
</div><div class="p">says the Lord Yahweh.

<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of Tyre, yes, for four, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not turn away its punishment;

<sup>10&#160;</sup>but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, 
</div><div class="q2">and it will devour its palaces.”

<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four,

</div><div class="q2">and cast off all pity, 
</div><div class="q2">and his anger raged continually, 
</div><div class="q2">and he kept his wrath forever; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>but I will send a fire on Teman, 
</div><div class="q2">and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yes, for four, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not turn away its punishment, 
</div><div class="q2">because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, 
</div><div class="q2">that they may enlarge their border. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, 
</div><div class="q2">and it will devour its palaces,

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not turn away its punishment, 
</div><div class="q2">because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>but I will send a fire on Moab, 
</div><div class="q2">and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; 
</div><div class="q2">and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and I will cut off the judge from among them, 
</div><div class="q2">and will kill all its princes with him,” 
</div><div class="p">says Yahweh.

<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not turn away its punishment,

</div><div class="q2">and have not kept his statutes, 
</div><div class="q2">and their lies have led them astray, 
</div><div class="q2">after which their fathers walked; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>but I will send a fire on Judah, 
</div><div class="q2">and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not turn away its punishment, 
</div><div class="q2">because they have sold the righteous for silver, 
</div><div class="q2">and the needy for a pair of sandals; 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth 
</div><div class="q2">and deny justice to the oppressed. 
</div><div class="q1">A man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my set-apart name. 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>They lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge. 
</div><div class="q2">In the house of their Elohim they drink the wine of those who have been fined. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, 
</div><div class="q2">whose height was like the height of the cedars, 
</div><div class="q2">and he was strong as the oaks; 
</div><div class="q2">yet I destroyed his fruit from above, 
</div><div class="q2">and his roots from beneath. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt 
</div><div class="q2">and led you forty years in the wilderness, 
</div><div class="q2">to possess the land of the Amorite. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>I raised up some of your sons for prophets, 
</div><div class="q2">and some of your young men for Nazirites. 
</div><div class="q1">Isn’t this true, 
</div><div class="q2">you children of Israel?” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, 
</div><div class="q2">and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t prophesy!’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Behold, I will crush you in your place, 
</div><div class="q2">as a cart crushes that is full of grain. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Flight will perish from the swift. 
</div><div class="q2">The strong won’t strengthen his force. 
</div><div class="q2">The mighty won’t deliver himself. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He who handles the bow won’t stand. 
</div><div class="q2">He who is swift of foot won’t escape. 
</div><div class="q2">He who rides the horse won’t deliver himself. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>He who is courageous among the mighty 
</div><div class="q2">will flee away naked on that day,” 
</div><div class="p">says Yahweh. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying: 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“I have only chosen you of all the families of the earth. 
</div><div class="q2">Therefore I will punish you for all of your sins.” 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Do two walk together, 
</div><div class="q2">unless they have agreed? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Will a lion roar in the thicket, 
</div><div class="q2">when he has no prey? 
</div><div class="q1">Does a young lion cry out of his den, 
</div><div class="q2">if he has caught nothing? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth, 
</div><div class="q2">where no snare is set for him? 
</div><div class="q1">Does a snare spring up from the ground, 
</div><div class="q2">when there is nothing to catch? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city, 
</div><div class="q2">without the people being afraid? 
</div><div class="q1">Does evil happen to a city, 
</div><div class="q2">and Yahweh hasn’t done it? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing, 
</div><div class="q2">unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The lion has roared. 
</div><div class="q2">Who will not fear? 
</div><div class="q1">The Lord Yahweh has spoken. 
</div><div class="q2">Who can but prophesy? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod, 
</div><div class="q2">and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, 
</div><div class="q1">and say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, 
</div><div class="q2">and see what unrest is in her, 
</div><div class="q2">and what oppression is among them.” 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“Indeed they don’t know to do right,” says Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">“Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“An adversary will overrun the land; 
</div><div class="q2">and he will pull down your strongholds, 
</div><div class="q2">and your fortresses will be plundered.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, 
</div><div class="q2">or a piece of an ear, 
</div><div class="q2">so shall the children of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch, 
</div><div class="q2">and on the silken cushions of a bed.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob,” says the Lord Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him, 
</div><div class="q2">I will also visit the altars of Bethel; 
</div><div class="q2">and the horns of the altar will be cut off, 
</div><div class="q2">and fall to the ground. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will strike the winter house with the summer house; 
</div><div class="q2">and the houses of ivory will perish, 
</div><div class="q2">and the great houses will have an end,” 
</div><div class="p">says Yahweh. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Listen to this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who tell their lords, “Bring us drinks!” 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his set-apartness, 
</div><div class="q2">“Behold, the days shall come on you that they will take you away with hooks, 
</div><div class="q2">and the last of you with fish hooks. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>You will go out at the breaks in the wall, 
</div><div class="q2">everyone straight before her; 
</div><div class="q2">and you will cast yourselves into Harmon,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Go to Bethel, and sin; 
</div><div class="q2">to Gilgal, and sin more. 
</div><div class="q1">Bring your sacrifices every morning, 
</div><div class="q2">your tithes every three days, 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, 
</div><div class="q2">and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them; 
</div><div class="q2">for this pleases you, you children of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, 
</div><div class="q2">and lack of bread in every town; 
</div><div class="q2">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“I also have withheld the rain from you, 
</div><div class="q2">when there were yet three months to the harvest; 
</div><div class="q2">and I caused it to rain on one city, 
</div><div class="q2">and caused it not to rain on another city. 
</div><div class="q1">One field was rained on, 
</div><div class="q2">and the field where it didn’t rain withered. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water, 
</div><div class="q2">and were not satisfied; 
</div><div class="q2">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens and your vineyards, 
</div><div class="q2">and the swarming locusts have devoured your fig trees and your olive trees; 
</div><div class="q2">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“I sent plagues among you like I did Egypt. 
</div><div class="q2">I have slain your young men with the sword, 
</div><div class="q2">and have carried away your horses. 
</div><div class="q1">I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camp, 
</div><div class="q2">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“I have overthrown some of you, 
</div><div class="q2">as when Elohim overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, 
</div><div class="q2">and you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire; 
</div><div class="q2">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Therefore I will do this to you, Israel; 
</div><div class="q2">because I will do this to you, 
</div><div class="q2">prepare to meet your Elohim, Israel. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>For, behold, he who forms the mountains, creates the wind, declares to man what is his thought, 
</div><div class="q2">who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth: 
</div><div class="q2">Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, is his name.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel: 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“The virgin of Israel has fallen; 
</div><div class="q2">She shall rise no more. 
</div><div class="q1">She is cast down on her land; 
</div><div class="q2">there is no one to raise her up.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For the Lord Yahweh says: 
</div><div class="q1">“The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left, 
</div><div class="q2">and that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says to the house of Israel: 
</div><div class="q1">“Seek me, and you will live; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>but don’t seek Bethel, 
</div><div class="q2">nor enter into Gilgal, 
</div><div class="q2">and don’t pass to Beersheba; 
</div><div class="q1">for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, 
</div><div class="q2">and Bethel shall come to nothing. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Seek Yahweh, and you will live, 
</div><div class="q2">lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, 
</div><div class="q2">and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>You who turn justice to wormwood, 
</div><div class="q2">and cast down righteousness to the earth! 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, 
</div><div class="q2">and turns the shadow of death into the morning, 
</div><div class="q2">and makes the day dark with night; 
</div><div class="q2">who calls for the waters of the sea, 
</div><div class="q2">and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>who brings sudden destruction on the strong, 
</div><div class="q2">so that destruction comes on the fortress. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>They hate him who reproves in the gate, 
</div><div class="q2">and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Therefore, because you trample on the poor and take taxes from him of wheat, 
</div><div class="q2">you have built houses of cut stone, but you will not dwell in them. 
</div><div class="q1">You have planted pleasant vineyards, 
</div><div class="q2">but you shall not drink their wine. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>For I know how many are your offenses, 
</div><div class="q2">and how great are your sins—</div><div class="q2">you who afflict the just, 
</div><div class="q2">who take a bribe, 
</div><div class="q2">and who turn away the needy in the courts. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time, 
</div><div class="q2">for it is an evil time. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Seek good, and not evil, 
</div><div class="q2">that you may live; 
</div><div class="q2">and so Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, will be with you, 
</div><div class="q2">as you say. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Hate evil, love good, 
</div><div class="q2">and establish justice in the courts. 
</div><div class="q2">It may be that Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, the Lord, says: 
</div><div class="q1">“Wailing will be in all the wide ways. 
</div><div class="q2">They will say in all the streets, ‘Alas! Alas!’ 
</div><div class="q2">They will call the farmer to mourning, 
</div><div class="q2">and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>In all vineyards there will be wailing, 
</div><div class="q2">for I will pass through the middle of you,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh! 
</div><div class="q2">Why do you long for the day of Yahweh? 
</div><div class="q1">It is darkness, 
</div><div class="q2">and not light. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>As if a man fled from a lion, 
</div><div class="q2">and a bear met him; 
</div><div class="q1">or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, 
</div><div class="q2">and a snake bit him. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Won’t the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light? 
</div><div class="q2">Even very dark, and no brightness in it? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I hate, I despise your feasts, 
</div><div class="q2">and I can’t stand your solemn assemblies. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, 
</div><div class="q2">I will not accept them; 
</div><div class="q2">neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Take away from me the noise of your songs! 
</div><div class="q2">I will not listen to the music of your harps. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>But let justice roll on like rivers,

<sup>25&#160;</sup>“Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and behold, it was the latter growth after the king’s harvest.

<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahweh relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” says Yahweh.
