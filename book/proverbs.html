<sup>1&#160;</sup>The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>to know wisdom and instruction; 
</div><div class="q2">to discern the words of understanding; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>to receive instruction in wise dealing, 
</div><div class="q2">in righteousness, justice, and equity; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>to give prudence to the simple, 
</div><div class="q2">knowledge and discretion to the young man—</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; 
</div><div class="q2">that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>to understand a proverb and parables, 
</div><div class="q2">the words and riddles of the wise. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge, 
</div><div class="q2">but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>My son, listen to your father’s instruction, 
</div><div class="q2">and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>for they will be a garland to grace your head, 
</div><div class="q2">and chains around your neck. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>My son, if sinners entice you, 
</div><div class="q2">don’t consent. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>If they say, “Come with us. 
</div><div class="q2">Let’s lie in wait for blood. 
</div><div class="q2">Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol, 
</div><div class="q2">and whole, like those who go down into the pit. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>We’ll find all valuable wealth. 
</div><div class="q2">We’ll fill our houses with plunder. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>You shall cast your lot among us. 
</div><div class="q2">We’ll all have one purse”—</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>my son, don’t walk on the path with them. 
</div><div class="q2">Keep your foot from their path, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>for their feet run to evil. 
</div><div class="q2">They hurry to shed blood. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>but these lay in wait for their own blood. 
</div><div class="q2">They lurk secretly for their own lives. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. 
</div><div class="q2">It takes away the life of its owners. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Wisdom calls aloud in the street. 
</div><div class="q2">She utters her voice in the public squares. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>She calls at the head of noisy places. 
</div><div class="q2">At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words: 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? 
</div><div class="q2">How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, 
</div><div class="q2">and fools hate knowledge? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Turn at my reproof. 
</div><div class="q2">Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. 
</div><div class="q2">I will make known my words to you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Because I have called, and you have refused; 
</div><div class="q2">I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>but you have ignored all my counsel, 
</div><div class="q2">and wanted none of my reproof; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>I also will laugh at your disaster. 
</div><div class="q2">I will mock when calamity overtakes you, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>when calamity overtakes you like a storm, 
</div><div class="q2">when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, 
</div><div class="q2">when distress and anguish come on you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. 
</div><div class="q2">They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>because they hated knowledge, 
</div><div class="q2">and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>They wanted none of my counsel. 
</div><div class="q2">They despised all my reproof. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, 
</div><div class="q2">and be filled with their own schemes. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. 
</div><div class="q2">The careless ease of fools will destroy them. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, 
</div><div class="q2">and will be at ease, without fear of harm.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>My son, if you will receive my words, 
</div><div class="q2">and store up my commandments within you, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>so as to turn your ear to wisdom, 
</div><div class="q2">and apply your heart to understanding; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>yes, if you call out for discernment, 
</div><div class="q2">and lift up your voice for understanding; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>if you seek her as silver, 
</div><div class="q2">and search for her as for hidden treasures; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">and find the knowledge of Elohim. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>For Yahweh gives wisdom. 
</div><div class="q2">Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. 
</div><div class="q2">He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>that he may guard the paths of justice, 
</div><div class="q2">and preserve the way of his saints. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then you will understand righteousness and justice, 
</div><div class="q2">equity and every good path. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>For wisdom will enter into your heart. 
</div><div class="q2">Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Discretion will watch over you. 
</div><div class="q2">Understanding will keep you, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>to deliver you from the way of evil, 
</div><div class="q2">from the men who speak perverse things, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>who forsake the paths of uprightness, 
</div><div class="q2">to walk in the ways of darkness, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>who rejoice to do evil, 
</div><div class="q2">and delight in the perverseness of evil, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>who are crooked in their ways, 
</div><div class="q2">and wayward in their paths, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>to deliver you from the strange woman, 
</div><div class="q2">even from the foreigner who flatters with her words, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>who forsakes the friend of her youth, 
</div><div class="q2">and forgets the covenant of her Elohim; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>for her house leads down to death, 
</div><div class="q2">her paths to the departed spirits. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>None who go to her return again, 
</div><div class="q2">neither do they attain to the paths of life. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Therefore walk in the way of good men, 
</div><div class="q2">and keep the paths of the righteous. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>For the upright will dwell in the land. 
</div><div class="q2">The perfect will remain in it. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>But the wicked will be cut off from the land. 
</div><div class="q2">The treacherous will be rooted out of it. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>My son, don’t forget my teaching, 
</div><div class="q2">but let your heart keep my commandments, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>for they will add to you length of days, 
</div><div class="q2">years of life, and peace. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. 
</div><div class="q2">Bind them around your neck. 
</div><div class="q2">Write them on the tablet of your heart. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>So you will find favor, 
</div><div class="q2">and good understanding in the sight of Elohim and man. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, 
</div><div class="q2">and don’t lean on your own understanding. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>In all your ways acknowledge him, 
</div><div class="q2">and he will make your paths straight. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Don’t be wise in your own eyes. 
</div><div class="q2">Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>It will be health to your body, 
</div><div class="q2">and nourishment to your bones. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Honor Yahweh with your substance, 
</div><div class="q2">with the first fruits of all your increase; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>so your barns will be filled with plenty, 
</div><div class="q2">and your vats will overflow with new wine. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline, 
</div><div class="q2">neither be weary of his correction; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects, 
</div><div class="q2">even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Happy is the man who finds wisdom, 
</div><div class="q2">the man who gets understanding. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>For her good profit is better than getting silver, 
</div><div class="q2">and her return is better than fine gold. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>She is more precious than rubies. 
</div><div class="q2">None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Length of days is in her right hand. 
</div><div class="q2">In her left hand are riches and honor. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Her ways are ways of pleasantness. 
</div><div class="q2">All her paths are peace. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. 
</div><div class="q2">Happy is everyone who retains her. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. 
</div><div class="q2">By understanding, he established the heavens. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, 
</div><div class="q2">and the skies drop down the dew. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>My son, let them not depart from your eyes. 
</div><div class="q2">Keep sound wisdom and discretion, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>so they will be life to your soul, 
</div><div class="q2">and grace for your neck. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Then you shall walk in your way securely. 
</div><div class="q2">Your foot won’t stumble. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>When you lie down, you will not be afraid. 
</div><div class="q2">Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, 
</div><div class="q2">neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>for Yahweh will be your confidence, 
</div><div class="q2">and will keep your foot from being taken. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, 
</div><div class="q2">when it is in the power of your hand to do it. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; 
</div><div class="q2">tomorrow I will give it to you,” 
</div><div class="q2">when you have it by you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, 
</div><div class="q2">since he dwells securely by you. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Don’t strive with a man without cause, 
</div><div class="q2">if he has done you no harm. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Don’t envy the man of violence. 
</div><div class="q2">Choose none of his ways. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">but his friendship is with the upright. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked, 
</div><div class="q2">but he blesses the habitation of the righteous. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Surely he mocks the mockers, 
</div><div class="q2">but he gives grace to the humble. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>35&#160;</sup>The wise will inherit glory, 
</div><div class="q2">but shame will be the promotion of fools. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. 
</div><div class="q2">Pay attention and know understanding;

<sup>2&#160;</sup>for I give you sound learning. 
</div><div class="q2">Don’t forsake my law.

<div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. 
</div><div class="q2">The years of your life will be many.
