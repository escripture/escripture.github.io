<span class="v">5&#160;</span>that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; 
</p><p class="q2">that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel; 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>to understand a proverb and parables, 
</p><p class="q2">the words and riddles of the wise.

<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The fear of Yehovah<span class="f">+ \fr 1:7 \ft “Yehovah” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> is the beginning of knowledge, 
</p><p class="q2">but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>My son, listen to your father’s instruction, 
</p><p class="q2">and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching; 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>for they will be a garland to grace your head, 
</p><p class="q2">and chains around your neck. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>My son, if sinners entice you, 
</p><p class="q2">don’t consent. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>If they say, “Come with us.

</p><p class="q2">Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:12 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.</span>

</p><p class="q2">They hurry to shed blood.

<span class="v">17&#160;</span>For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any owner of wings;

<span class="v">18&#160;</span>but these lay in wait for their own blood. 
</p><p class="q2">They lurk secretly for their own lives.

<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Wisdom calls aloud in the street.

<span class="v">22&#160;</span>“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?

<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Turn at my reproof. 
</p><p class="q2">Behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:23 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> I will pour out my spirit on you.

<span class="v">25&#160;</span>but you have ignored all my counsel,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>I also will laugh at your disaster. 
</p><p class="q2">I will mock when calamity overtakes you,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. 
</p><p class="q2">They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>because they hated knowledge, 
</p><p class="q2">and didn’t choose the fear of Yehovah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>They wanted none of my counsel. 
</p><p class="q2">They despised all my reproof.

<span class="v">32&#160;</span>For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
