<div class="chapterlabel" id="1"> 1</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the elohim of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> But Yehovah’s<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Yehovah” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span></a> angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because there is no Elohim<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a> in Israel that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the elohim of Ekron?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Now therefore Yehovah says, “You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.” ’ ” Then Elijah departed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Yehovah says, ‘Is it because there is no Elohim in Israel that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the elohim of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’ ” ’ ” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and told you these words?” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> They answered him, “He was a man, an owner of hair, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.” </div><div class="p">He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “Man of Elohim, the king has said, ‘Come down!’ ” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of Elohim, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of Elohim, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’ ” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of Elohim, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then Elohim’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of Elohim, please let my life and the life of these fifty of your servants be precious in your sight.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Behold, fire came down from the sky and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Yehovah’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” </div><div class="p">Then he arose and went down with him to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> He said to him, “Yehovah says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the elohim of Ekron, is it because there is no Elohim in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’ ” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> So he died according to Yehovah’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </div>

<div class="chapterlabel" id="2"> 2</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> When Yehovah was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yehovah has sent me as far as Bethel.” </div><div class="p">Elisha said, “As Yehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yehovah will take away your master from over you today?” </div><div class="p">He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yehovah has sent me to Jericho.” </div><div class="p">He said, “As Yehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yehovah will take away your master from over you today?” </div><div class="p">He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for Yehovah has sent me to the Jordan.” </div><div class="p">He said, “As Yehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters; and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” </div><div class="p">Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” </div><div class="p">He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yehovah, the Elohim of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yehovah’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain or into some valley.” </div><div class="p">He said, “Don’t send them.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.” </div><div class="p">Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> They came back to him while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’ ” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yehovah says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yehovah’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of those youths.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria. </div>

<div class="chapterlabel" id="3"> 3</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> He did that which was evil in Yehovah’s sight, but not like his father and like his mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?” </div><div class="p">He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?” </div><div class="p">Jehoram answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of Yehovah here, that we may inquire of Yehovah by him?” </div><div class="p">One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Jehoshaphat said, “Yehovah’s word is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.” </div><div class="p">The king of Israel said to him, “No, for Yehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Elisha said, “As Yehovah of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, Yehovah’s hand came on him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> He said, “Yehovah says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For Yehovah says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your other animals.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> This is an easy thing in Yehovah’s sight. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> You shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’ ” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, young and old, and stood on the border.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it and attacked it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land. </div>

<div class="chapterlabel" id="4"> 4</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Now a certain woman of the women of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my man is dead. You know that your servant feared Yehovah. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Elisha said to her, “What should I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” </div><div class="p">She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Then he said, “Go, borrow empty containers from all your neighbors. Don’t borrow just a few containers.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Go in and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour oil into all those containers; and set aside those which are full.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> So she went from him, and shut the door on herself and on her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she poured oil.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.” </div><div class="p">He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” Then the oil stopped flowing. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Then she came and told the man of Elohim. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> She said to her man, “See now, I perceive that this is a set-apart man of Elohim who passes by us continually.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Please, let’s make a little room on the roof. Let’s set a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand for him there. When he comes to us, he can stay there.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> One day he came there, and he went to the room and lay there.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?’ ” </div><div class="p">She answered, “I dwell among my own people.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> He said, “What then is to be done for her?” </div><div class="p">Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and her man is old.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> He said, “At this season next year, you will embrace a son.” </div><div class="p">She said, “No, my lord, you man of Elohim, do not lie to your servant.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> He said to his father, “My head! My head!” </div><div class="p">He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> She went up and laid him on the man of Elohim’s bed, and shut the door on him, and went out.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> She called to her man and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of Elohim and come again.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> He said, “Why would you want to go to him today? It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.” </div><div class="p">She said, “It’s all right.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> So she went, and came to the man of Elohim to Mount Carmel. When the man of Elohim saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Please run now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your man? Is it well with your child?’ ” </div><div class="p">She answered, “It is well.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> When she came to the man of Elohim to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of Elohim said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and Yehovah has hidden it from me, and has not told me.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me’?” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child’s face.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> The child’s mother said, “As Yehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” </div><div class="p">So he arose, and followed her. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child’s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awakened.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yehovah.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> He went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth, then went up and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her. </div><div class="p">When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> Then she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; then she picked up her son, and went out. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.” </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognize them.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> So they poured out for the men to eat.
