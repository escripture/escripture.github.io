<div class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob): 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>All the souls who came out of Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Come, let’s deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies and fight against us, and escape out of the land.” 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They started to dread the children of Israel. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.” 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>But the midwives feared Elohim, and didn’t do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Elohim dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Because the midwives feared Elohim, he gave them families. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his woman. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her servant to get it. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” 
</div><div class="p">The young woman went and called the child’s mother. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” 
</div><div class="p">The woman took the child, and nursed it. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” 
</div><div class="p">Moses was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.” 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to Elohim because of the bondage. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Elohim heard their groaning, and Elohim remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Elohim saw the children of Israel, and Elohim understood. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to Elohim’s mountain, to Horeb. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Moses said, “I will go now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>When Yahweh saw that he came over to see, Elohim called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses! Moses!” 
</div><div class="p">He said, “Here I am.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>He said, “Don’t come close. Take off your sandals, for the place you are standing on is set-apart ground.” 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Moreover he said, “I am the Elohim of your father, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob.” 
</div><div class="p">Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at Elohim. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Yahweh said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Moses said to Elohim, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>He said, “Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve Elohim on this mountain.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Moses said to Elohim, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Elohim of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I tell them?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Elohim said to Moses, “I will be who I will be,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I will be has sent me to you.’&#160;” 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Elohim said moreover to Moses, “You shall tell the children of Israel this, ‘Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”&#160;’ 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>They will listen to your voice. You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, ‘Yahweh, the Elohim of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our Elohim.’ 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing. You shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Moses answered, “But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, ‘Yahweh has not appeared to you.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to him, “What is that in your hand?” 
</div><div class="p">He said, “A rod.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He said, “Throw it on the ground.” 
</div><div class="p">He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail.” 
</div><div class="p">He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“This is so that they may believe that Yahweh, the Elohim of their fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, has appeared to you.” 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Yahweh said furthermore to him, “Now put your hand inside your cloak.” 
</div><div class="p">He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak again.” 
</div><div class="p">He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>“It will happen, if they will not believe you or listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Moses said to Yahweh, “O Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn’t it I, Yahweh? 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Moses said, “Oh, Lord, please send someone else.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s anger burned against Moses, and he said, “What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he is coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>He will be your spokesman to the people. It will happen that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as Elohim. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.” 
</div><div class="p">Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Moses took his woman and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took Elohim’s rod in his hand. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘Yahweh says, Israel is my son, my firstborn, 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>and I have said to you, “Let my son go, that he may serve me;” and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>On the way at a lodging place, Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>So he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” 
</div><div class="p">He went, and met him on Elohim’s mountain, and kissed him. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Moses told Aaron all Yahweh’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, “This is what Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don’t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>They said, “The Elohim of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our Elohim, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!” 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.” 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying, 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to our Elohim.’ 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it. Don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The taskmasters of the people went out with their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you straw. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’&#160;” 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!” 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants? 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>But Pharaoh said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to Yahweh.’ 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Go therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said, “You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along the way, as they came out from Pharaoh. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>They said to them, “May Yahweh look at you and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me? 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people. You have not rescued your people at all!” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Elohim spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am Yahweh. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as Elohim Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I will take you to myself for a people. I will be your Elohim; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your Elohim, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel haven’t listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, when I have uncircumcised lips?” 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the Elohim of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, that they may serve me.

<sup>19&#160;</sup>There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a foreigner, or one who is born in the land. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, “Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two door posts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you, as he has promised, that you shall keep this service. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>It will happen, when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’ 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>that you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of Yahweh’s Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">The people bowed their heads and worshiped. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>At midnight, Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of livestock. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said! 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.” 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing. 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They plundered the Egyptians. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>37&#160;</sup>The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, in addition to children. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, and they had not prepared any food for themselves. 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years. 
<sup>41&#160;</sup>At the end of four hundred thirty years, to the day, all of Yahweh’s armies went out from the land of Egypt. 
<sup>42&#160;</sup>It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed by all the children of Israel throughout their generations. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>43&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat of it, 
<sup>44&#160;</sup>but every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it. 
<sup>45&#160;</sup>A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it. 
<sup>46&#160;</sup>It must be eaten in one house. You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the house. Do not break any of its bones. 
<sup>47&#160;</sup>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
<sup>48&#160;</sup>When a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, and would like to keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it. He shall be as one who is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. 
<sup>49&#160;</sup>One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.” 
<sup>50&#160;</sup>All the children of Israel did so. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did. 
<sup>51&#160;</sup>That same day, Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="13">13</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Today you go out in the month Abib. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>It shall be, when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you. No yeast shall be seen with you, within all your borders. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>You shall tell your son in that day, saying, ‘It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that Yahweh’s law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“It shall be, when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and will give it to you,

<sup>13&#160;</sup>Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons.

<sup>15&#160;</sup>When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of livestock. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>When Pharaoh had let the people go, Elohim didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for Elohim said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt”; 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>but Elohim led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, “Elohim will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.” 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night: 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the people.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.’ 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh.” They did so. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The king of Egypt was told that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him; 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, with captains over all of them. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>The Egyptians pursued them. All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>When Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>They said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt? 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Isn’t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today; for you will never again see the Egyptians whom you have seen today. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. Then the children of Israel shall go into the middle of the sea on dry ground. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Behold, I myself will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them. I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.” 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The angel of Elohim, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. There was the cloud and the darkness, yet it gave light by night. One didn’t come near the other all night. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>The children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.” 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh and in his servant Moses.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness; 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and the children of Israel said to them, “We wish that we had died by Yahweh’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”

<sup>8&#160;</sup>Moses said, “Now Yahweh will give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you, because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh.” 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come close to Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.’&#160;” 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, Yahweh’s glory appeared in the cloud. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your Elohim.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>When the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: ‘Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.’&#160;” 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, some less. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They each gathered according to his eating. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.” 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Notwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>He said to them, “This is that which Yahweh has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a set-apart Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’&#160;” 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>They laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.” 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.” 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>So the people rested on the seventh day. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>The house of Israel called its name “Manna”, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey. 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’&#160;” 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.” 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, starting according to Yahweh’s commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” 
</div><div class="p">Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>The people were thirsty for water there; so the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”

<sup>4&#160;</sup>Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”

<sup>8&#160;</sup>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with Elohim’s rod in my hand.” 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>But Moses’ hands were heavy; so they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.” 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Moses built an altar, and called its name “Yahweh our Banner”. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>He said, “Yah has sworn: ‘Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.’&#160;”

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that Elohim had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ woman, after he had sent her away, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land”. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, “My father’s Elohim was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword.” 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and his woman to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of Elohim. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>He said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your woman, and her two sons with her.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Jethro said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all elohims because of the way that they treated people arrogantly.” 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for Elohim. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before Elohim. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of Elohim. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of Elohim, and his laws.” 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and Elohim be with you. You represent the people before Elohim, and bring the causes to Elohim. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear Elohim: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>If you will do this thing, and Elohim commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard cases to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Moses went up to Elohim, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;

</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.

</div><div class="p">Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.” Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>and be ready for the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Moses led the people out of the camp to meet Elohim; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>All of Mount Sinai smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and Elohim answered him by a voice. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break out on them.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Moses said to Yahweh, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break out against them.”

<div class="p">

<sup>18&#160;</sup>All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

<sup>6&#160;</sup>Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:

<sup>12&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

<sup>14&#160;</sup>You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is set-apart to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, set-apart to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>When he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant, stone tablets, written with Elohim’s finger. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="32">32</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>When the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us elohims, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Aaron said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your women, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He received what they handed him, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molded calf. Then they said, “These are your elohims, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves! 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>They have turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molded calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your elohims, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Moses begged Yahweh his Elohim, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth’? Turn from your fierce wrath, and turn away from this evil against your people. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>So Yahweh turned away from the evil which he said he would do to his people. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides. They were written on one side and on the other. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The tablets were the work of Elohim, and the writing was the writing of Elohim, engraved on the tablets. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>He said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.” 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>As soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Aaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>For they said to me, ‘Make us elohims, which shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’ 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them take it off.’ So they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>When Moses saw that the people were out of control, (for Aaron had let them lose control, causing derision among their enemies), 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me!” 
</div><div class="p">All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>He said to them, “Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’&#160;” 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. About three thousand men fell of the people that day. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, for every man was against his son and against his brother, that he may give you a blessing today.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>On the next day, Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves elohims of gold. 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot him out of my book. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.” 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>Yahweh struck the people, because of what they did with the calf, which Aaron made. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="33">33</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Go to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>When the people heard this evil news, they mourned; and no one put on his jewelry. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahweh had said to Moses, “Tell the children of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up among you for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it “The Tent of Meeting.” Everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>When Moses went out to the Tent, all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>When Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and Yahweh spoke with Moses. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn’t depart from the Tent. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Moses said to Yahweh, “Behold, you tell me, ‘Bring up this people;’ and you haven’t let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’ 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me your way, now, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight; and consider that this nation is your people.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Moses said to him, “If your presence doesn’t go with me, don’t carry us up from here. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn’t it that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>He said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim Yahweh’s name before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.” 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He said, “You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live.” 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yahweh also said, “Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="34">34</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Chisel two stone tablets like the first. I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>No one shall come up with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain. Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; then Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed Yahweh’s name. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, “Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious Elohim, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth, 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children’s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>He said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go among us, even though this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>He said, “Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Observe that which I command you today. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare among you; 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherah poles; 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>for you shall worship no other elohim; for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous Elohim.

<sup>32&#160;</sup>Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so they did. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>They brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow hides, the veil of the screen, 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>the ark of the covenant with its poles, the mercy seat, 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>the table, all its vessels, the show bread, 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>the pure lamp stand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order, all its vessels, the oil for the light, 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the door of the Tent, 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>the bronze altar, its grating of bronze, its poles, all of its vessels, the basin and its base, 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>the hangings of the court, its pillars, its sockets, the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, its pins, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the Tent of Meeting, 
<sup>41&#160;</sup>the finely worked garments for ministering in the set-apart place, the set-apart garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office. 
<sup>42&#160;</sup>According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work. 
<sup>43&#160;</sup>Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as Yahweh had commanded. They had done so; and Moses blessed them.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>You shall put the ark of the covenant in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it. You shall bring in the lamp stand, and light its lamps. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the covenant, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall make it set-apart, and all its furniture, and it will be set-apart. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar, and the altar will be most set-apart. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>You shall put on Aaron the set-apart garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest’s office. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>You shall bring his sons, and put tunics on them. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest’s office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.” 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Moses did so. According to all that Yahweh commanded him, so he did. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was raised up. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He took and put the covenant into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the covenant, as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside of the veil. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>He put the lamp stand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil; 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>and he burned incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there. 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and Yahweh’s glory filled the tabernacle. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>Moses wasn’t able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh’s glory filled the tabernacle. 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys; 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>but if the cloud wasn’t taken up, then they didn’t travel until the day that it was taken up. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. </div></div><script src="../main.js"></script></body></html>
