<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="1">1</h2>
<p class="p1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Yahweh’s<span class="f">+ \fr 1:1 \ft “Yahweh” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> word that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>When Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a woman of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahweh.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Yahweh said to him, “Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>She conceived again, and bore a daughter. 
</p><p>Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:6 \ft Lo-Ruhamah means “not loved”.</span> for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their Elohim,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:7 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:9 \ft Lo-Ammi means “not my people”.</span> for you are not my people, and I will not be yours. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be measured or counted; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living Elohim.’ 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>“Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’<span class="f">+ \fr 2:1 \ft ‘Ammi’ in Hebrew</span> 
</p><p class="q2">and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’<span class="f">+ \fr 2:1 \ft ‘Ruhamah’ in Hebrew</span> 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Contend with your mother! 
</p><p class="q2">Contend, for she is not my woman, 
</p><p class="q2">neither am I her man; 
</p><p class="q1">and let her put away her prostitution from her face, 
</p><p class="q2">and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>lest I strip her naked, 
</p><p class="q2">and make her bare as in the day that she was born, 
</p><p class="q1">and make her like a wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">and set her like a dry land, 
</p><p class="q2">and kill her with thirst. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy, 
</p><p class="q2">for they are children of unfaithfulness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>For their mother has played the prostitute. 
</p><p class="q2">She who conceived them has done shamefully; 
</p><p class="q1">for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, 
</p><p class="q2">who give me my bread and my water, 
</p><p class="q2">my wool and my flax, 
</p><p class="q2">my oil and my drink.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Therefore behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 2:6 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> I will hedge up your way with thorns, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will build a wall against her, 
</p><p class="q2">that she can’t find her way. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>She will follow after her lovers, 
</p><p class="q2">but she won’t overtake them; 
</p><p class="q1">and she will seek them, 
</p><p class="q2">but won’t find them. 
</p><p class="q1">Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first man, 
</p><p class="q2">for then it was better with me than now.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, 
</p><p class="q2">and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, 
</p><p class="q2">and my new wine in its season, 
</p><p class="q2">and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, 
</p><p class="q2">and no one will deliver her out of my hand. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>I will also cause all her celebrations to cease: 
</p><p class="q2">her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, 
</p><p class="q2">about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me,’ 
</p><p class="q2">and I will make them a forest, 
</p><p class="q2">and the animals of the field shall eat them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>I will visit on her the days of the Baals, 
</p><p class="q2">to which she burned incense 
</p><p class="q1">when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, 
</p><p class="q2">and went after her lovers 
</p><p class="q2">and forgot me,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>“Therefore behold, I will allure her, 
</p><p class="q2">and bring her into the wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">and speak tenderly to her. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>I will give her vineyards from there, 
</p><p class="q2">and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; 
</p><p class="q1">and she will respond there 
</p><p class="q2">as in the days of her youth, 
</p><p class="q2">and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>It will be in that day,” says Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">“that you will call me ‘my man,’ 
</p><p class="q2">and no longer call me ‘my owner.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, 
</p><p class="q2">and they will no longer be mentioned by name. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field, 
</p><p class="q2">and with the birds of the sky, 
</p><p class="q2">and with the creeping things of the ground. 
</p><p class="q1">I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land, 
</p><p class="q2">and will make them lie down safely. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>I will betroth you to me forever. 
</p><p class="q2">Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; 
</p><p class="q2">and you shall know Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>It will happen in that day, that I will respond,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q2">“I will respond to the heavens, 
</p><p class="q2">and they will respond to the earth; 
</p><p class="q2">
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; 
</p><p class="q2">and they will respond to Jezreel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>I will sow her to me in the earth; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’ 
</p><p class="q2">and they will say, ‘You are My Elohim!’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other elohims, and love cakes of raisins.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer<span class="f">+ \fr 3:2 \ft 1 homer is about 220 liters or 6 bushels</span> and a half of barley. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>For the children of Israel shall live many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek Yahweh their Elohim, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Hear Yahweh’s word, you children of Israel, 
</p><p class="q2">for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land: 
</p><p class="q1">“Indeed there is no truth, nor goodness, 
</p><p class="q2">nor knowledge of Elohim in the land. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; 
</p><p class="q2">they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Therefore the land will mourn, 
</p><p class="q2">and everyone who dwells in it will waste away, 
</p><p class="q1">with all living things in her, 
</p><p class="q2">even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky; 
</p><p class="q2">yes, the fish of the sea also die. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>“Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; 
</p><p class="q2">for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>You will stumble in the day, 
</p><p class="q2">and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will destroy your mother. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. 
</p><p class="q2">Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, 
</p><p class="q2">that you may be no priest to me. 
</p><p class="q1">Because you have forgotten your Elohim’s law, 
</p><p class="q2">I will also forget your children. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me. 
</p><p class="q2">I will change their glory into shame. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>They feed on the sin of my people, 
</p><p class="q2">and set their heart on their iniquity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>It will be like people, like priest; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will punish them for their ways, 
</p><p class="q2">and will repay them for their deeds. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>They will eat, and not have enough. 
</p><p class="q2">They will play the prostitute, and will not increase; 
</p><p class="q2">because they have abandoned listening to Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding. 
</p><p class="q2">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>My people consult with their wooden idol, 
</p><p class="q2">and answer to a stick of wood. 
</p><p class="q1">Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray, 
</p><p class="q2">and they have been unfaithful to their Elohim. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, 
</p><p class="q2">and burn incense on the hills, under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, 
</p><p class="q2">because its shade is good. 
</p><p class="q1">Therefore your daughters play the prostitute, 
</p><p class="q2">and your brides commit adultery. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute, 
</p><p class="q2">nor your brides when they commit adultery; 
</p><p class="q1">because the men consort with prostitutes, 
</p><p class="q2">and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes; 
</p><p class="q2">so the people without understanding will come to ruin.

</p><p class="q2">nor swear, ‘As Yahweh lives.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. 
</p><p class="q2">Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Ephraim is joined to idols.
