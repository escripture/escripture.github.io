<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
</p><p>
<sup>2&#160;</sup>When Yahuah spoke at first by Hosea, Yahuah said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a woman of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahuah.” 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son. 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahuah said to him, “Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.” 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>She conceived again, and bore a daughter. 
</p><p>Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahuah their Elohim, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.” 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi, for you are not my people, and I will not be yours. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be measured or counted; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living Elohim.’ 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’ 
</p><p class="q2">and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Contend with your mother! 
</p><p class="q2">Contend, for she is not my woman, 
</p><p class="q2">neither am I her man; 
</p><p class="q1">and let her put away her prostitution from her face, 
</p><p class="q2">and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>lest I strip her naked, 
</p><p class="q2">and make her bare as in the day that she was born, 
</p><p class="q1">and make her like a wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">and set her like a dry land, 
</p><p class="q2">and kill her with thirst. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy, 
</p><p class="q2">for they are children of unfaithfulness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>For their mother has played the prostitute. 
</p><p class="q2">She who conceived them has done shamefully; 
</p><p class="q1">for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, 
</p><p class="q2">who give me my bread and my water, 
</p><p class="q2">my wool and my flax, 
</p><p class="q2">my oil and my drink.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will build a wall against her, 
</p><p class="q2">that she can’t find her way. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>She will follow after her lovers, 
</p><p class="q2">but she won’t overtake them; 
</p><p class="q1">and she will seek them, 
</p><p class="q2">but won’t find them. 
</p><p class="q1">Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first man, 
</p><p class="q2">for then it was better with me than now.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, 
</p><p class="q2">and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, 
</p><p class="q2">and my new wine in its season, 
</p><p class="q2">and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, 
</p><p class="q2">and no one will deliver her out of my hand. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>I will also cause all her celebrations to cease: 
</p><p class="q2">her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, 
</p><p class="q2">about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me,’ 
</p><p class="q2">and I will make them a forest, 
</p><p class="q2">and the animals of the field shall eat them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I will visit on her the days of the Baals, 
</p><p class="q2">to which she burned incense 
</p><p class="q1">when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, 
</p><p class="q2">and went after her lovers 
</p><p class="q2">and forgot me,” says Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“Therefore behold, I will allure her, 
</p><p class="q2">and bring her into the wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">and speak tenderly to her. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will give her vineyards from there, 
</p><p class="q2">and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; 
</p><p class="q1">and she will respond there 
</p><p class="q2">as in the days of her youth, 
</p><p class="q2">and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>It will be in that day,” says Yahuah, 
</p><p class="q2">“that you will call me ‘my man,’ 
</p><p class="q2">and no longer call me ‘my owner.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, 
</p><p class="q2">and they will no longer be mentioned by name. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field, 
</p><p class="q2">and with the birds of the sky, 
</p><p class="q2">and with the creeping things of the ground. 
</p><p class="q1">I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land, 
</p><p class="q2">and will make them lie down safely. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>I will betroth you to me forever. 
</p><p class="q2">Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; 
</p><p class="q2">and you shall know Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>It will happen in that day, that I will respond,” says Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q2">“I will respond to the heavens, 
</p><p class="q2">and they will respond to the earth; 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; 
</p><p class="q2">and they will respond to Jezreel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>I will sow her to me in the earth; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’ 
</p><p class="q2">and they will say, ‘You are My Elohim!’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as Yahuah loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other elohims, and love cakes of raisins.” 
</p><p>
<sup>2&#160;</sup>So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you.” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For the children of Israel shall live many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek Yahuah their Elohim, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to Yahuah and to his blessings in the last days. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Hear Yahuah’s word, you children of Israel, 
</p><p class="q2">for Yahuah has a charge against the inhabitants of the land: 
</p><p class="q1">“Indeed there is no truth, nor goodness, 
</p><p class="q2">nor knowledge of Elohim in the land. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; 
</p><p class="q2">they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Therefore the land will mourn, 
</p><p class="q2">and everyone who dwells in it will waste away, 
</p><p class="q1">with all living things in her, 
</p><p class="q2">even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky; 
</p><p class="q2">yes, the fish of the sea also die. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; 
</p><p class="q2">for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>You will stumble in the day, 
</p><p class="q2">and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will destroy your mother. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. 
</p><p class="q2">Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, 
</p><p class="q2">that you may be no priest to me. 
</p><p class="q1">Because you have forgotten your Elohim’s law, 
</p><p class="q2">I will also forget your children. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me. 
</p><p class="q2">I will change their glory into shame. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>They feed on the sin of my people, 
</p><p class="q2">and set their heart on their iniquity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>It will be like people, like priest; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will punish them for their ways, 
</p><p class="q2">and will repay them for their deeds. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>They will eat, and not have enough. 
</p><p class="q2">They will play the prostitute, and will not increase; 
</p><p class="q2">because they have abandoned listening to Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding. 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>My people consult with their wooden idol, 
</p><p class="q2">and answer to a stick of wood. 
</p><p class="q1">Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray, 
</p><p class="q2">and they have been unfaithful to their Elohim. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, 
</p><p class="q2">and burn incense on the hills, under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, 
</p><p class="q2">because its shade is good. 
</p><p class="q1">Therefore your daughters play the prostitute, 
</p><p class="q2">and your brides commit adultery. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute, 
</p><p class="q2">nor your brides when they commit adultery; 
</p><p class="q1">because the men consort with prostitutes, 
</p><p class="q2">and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes; 
</p><p class="q2">so the people without understanding will come to ruin. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“Though you, Israel, play the prostitute, 
</p><p class="q2">yet don’t let Judah offend; 
</p><p class="q2">and don’t come to Gilgal, 
</p><p class="q2">neither go up to Beth Aven, 
</p><p class="q2">nor swear, ‘As Yahuah lives.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. 
</p><p class="q2">Then how will Yahuah feed them like a lamb in a meadow? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Ephraim is joined to idols. 
</p><p class="q2">Leave him alone! 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Their drink has become sour. 
</p><p class="q2">They play the prostitute continually. 
</p><p class="q2">Her rulers dearly love their shameful way. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings; 
</p><p class="q2">and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“Listen to this, you priests! 
</p><p class="q2">Listen, house of Israel, 
</p><p class="q2">and give ear, house of the king! 
</p><p class="q1">For the judgment is against you; 
</p><p class="q2">for you have been a snare at Mizpah, 
</p><p class="q2">and a net spread on Tabor. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The rebels are deep in slaughter, 
</p><p class="q2">but I discipline all of them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>I know Ephraim, 
</p><p class="q2">and Israel is not hidden from me; 
</p><p class="q1">for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute. 
</p><p class="q2">Israel is defiled. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">for the spirit of prostitution is within them, 
</p><p class="q2">and they don’t know Yahuah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The pride of Israel testifies to his face. 
</p><p class="q2">Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity. 
</p><p class="q2">Judah also will stumble with them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahuah, 
</p><p class="q2">but they won’t find him. 
</p><p class="q2">He has withdrawn himself from them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They are unfaithful to Yahuah; 
</p><p class="q2">for they have borne illegitimate children. 
</p><p class="q2">Now the new moon will devour them with their fields. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>“Blow the cornet in Gibeah, 
</p><p class="q2">and the trumpet in Ramah! 
</p><p class="q2">Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin! 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke. 
</p><p class="q2">Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark. 
</p><p class="q2">I will pour out my wrath on them like water. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Ephraim is oppressed, 
</p><p class="q2">he is crushed in judgment, 
</p><p class="q2">because he is intent in his pursuit of idols. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth, 
</p><p class="q2">and to the house of Judah like rottenness. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“When Ephraim saw his sickness, 
</p><p class="q2">and Judah his wound, 
</p><p class="q2">then Ephraim went to Assyria, 
</p><p class="q2">and sent to King Jareb: 
</p><p class="q1">but he is not able to heal you, 
</p><p class="q2">neither will he cure you of your wound. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, 
</p><p class="q2">and like a young lion to the house of Judah. 
</p><p class="q1">I myself will tear in pieces and go away. 
</p><p class="q2">I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will go and return to my place, 
</p><p class="q2">until they acknowledge their offense, 
</p><p class="q2">and seek my face. 
</p><p class="q2">In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”

<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“Come! Let’s return to Yahuah;

</p><p class="q2">and he will heal us; 
</p><p class="q1">he has injured us, 
</p><p class="q2">and he will bind up our wounds. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>After two days he will revive us.

<sup>4&#160;</sup>They are all adulterers. 
</p><p class="q2">They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,

<sup>5&#160;</sup>On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.

</p><p class="q2">and accept that which is good; 
</p><p class="q2">so we offer bulls as we vowed of our lips. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Assyria can’t save us. 
</p><p class="q2">We won’t ride on horses; 
</p><p class="q2">neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, ‘Our elohims!’ 
</p><p class="q2">for in you the fatherless finds mercy.” 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“I will heal their waywardness. 
</p><p class="q2">I will love them freely; 
</p><p class="q2">for my anger is turned away from them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>I will be like the dew to Israel. 
</p><p class="q2">He will blossom like the lily, 
</p><p class="q2">and send down his roots like Lebanon. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>His branches will spread, 
</p><p class="q2">and his beauty will be like the olive tree, 
</p><p class="q2">and his fragrance like Lebanon. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Men will dwell in his shade. 
</p><p class="q2">They will revive like the grain, 
</p><p class="q2">and blossom like the vine. 
</p><p class="q2">Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? 
</p><p class="q2">I answer, and will take care of him. 
</p><p class="q2">I am like a green cypress tree; 
</p><p class="q2">from me your fruit is found.”

<p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Who is wise, that he may understand these things? 
</p><p class="q2">Who is prudent, that he may know them? 
</p><p class="q2">For the ways of Yahuah are right, 
</p><p class="q2">and the righteous walk in them, 
</p><p class="q2">but the rebellious stumble in them. </p></div><script src="../main.js"></script></body></html>
