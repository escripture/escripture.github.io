<div class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>When Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a woman of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahweh.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to him, “Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>She conceived again, and bore a daughter. 
</div><div class="p">Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their Elohim, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi, for you are not my people, and I will not be yours. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be measured or counted; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living Elohim.’ 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’ 
</div><div class="q2">and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Contend with your mother! 
</div><div class="q2">Contend, for she is not my woman, 
</div><div class="q2">neither am I her man; 
</div><div class="q1">and let her put away her prostitution from her face, 
</div><div class="q2">and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>lest I strip her naked, 
</div><div class="q2">and make her bare as in the day that she was born, 
</div><div class="q1">and make her like a wilderness, 
</div><div class="q2">and set her like a dry land, 
</div><div class="q2">and kill her with thirst. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy, 
</div><div class="q2">for they are children of unfaithfulness. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>For their mother has played the prostitute. 
</div><div class="q2">She who conceived them has done shamefully; 
</div><div class="q1">for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, 
</div><div class="q2">who give me my bread and my water, 
</div><div class="q2">my wool and my flax, 
</div><div class="q2">my oil and my drink.’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, 
</div><div class="q2">and I will build a wall against her, 
</div><div class="q2">that she can’t find her way. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>She will follow after her lovers, 
</div><div class="q2">but she won’t overtake them; 
</div><div class="q1">and she will seek them, 
</div><div class="q2">but won’t find them. 
</div><div class="q1">Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first man, 
</div><div class="q2">for then it was better with me than now.’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, 
</div><div class="q2">and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, 
</div><div class="q2">and my new wine in its season, 
</div><div class="q2">and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, 
</div><div class="q2">and no one will deliver her out of my hand. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>I will also cause all her celebrations to cease: 
</div><div class="q2">her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, 
</div><div class="q2">about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me,’ 
</div><div class="q2">and I will make them a forest, 
</div><div class="q2">and the animals of the field shall eat them. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I will visit on her the days of the Baals, 
</div><div class="q2">to which she burned incense 
</div><div class="q1">when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, 
</div><div class="q2">and went after her lovers 
</div><div class="q2">and forgot me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“Therefore behold, I will allure her, 
</div><div class="q2">and bring her into the wilderness, 
</div><div class="q2">and speak tenderly to her. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will give her vineyards from there, 
</div><div class="q2">and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; 
</div><div class="q1">and she will respond there 
</div><div class="q2">as in the days of her youth, 
</div><div class="q2">and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>It will be in that day,” says Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">“that you will call me ‘my man,’ 
</div><div class="q2">and no longer call me ‘my owner.’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, 
</div><div class="q2">and they will no longer be mentioned by name. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field, 
</div><div class="q2">and with the birds of the sky, 
</div><div class="q2">and with the creeping things of the ground. 
</div><div class="q1">I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land, 
</div><div class="q2">and will make them lie down safely. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>I will betroth you to me forever. 
</div><div class="q2">Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; 
</div><div class="q2">and you shall know Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>It will happen in that day, that I will respond,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q2">“I will respond to the heavens, 
</div><div class="q2">and they will respond to the earth; 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; 
</div><div class="q2">and they will respond to Jezreel. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>I will sow her to me in the earth; 
</div><div class="q2">and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; 
</div><div class="q2">and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’ 
</div><div class="q2">and they will say, ‘You are My Elohim!’&#160;” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other elohims, and love cakes of raisins.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For the children of Israel shall live many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek Yahweh their Elohim, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Hear Yahweh’s word, you children of Israel, 
</div><div class="q2">for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land: 
</div><div class="q1">“Indeed there is no truth, nor goodness, 
</div><div class="q2">nor knowledge of Elohim in the land. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; 
</div><div class="q2">they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Therefore the land will mourn, 
</div><div class="q2">and everyone who dwells in it will waste away, 
</div><div class="q1">with all living things in her, 
</div><div class="q2">even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky; 
</div><div class="q2">yes, the fish of the sea also die. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; 
</div><div class="q2">for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>You will stumble in the day, 
</div><div class="q2">and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night; 
</div><div class="q2">and I will destroy your mother. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. 
</div><div class="q2">Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, 
</div><div class="q2">that you may be no priest to me. 
</div><div class="q1">Because you have forgotten your Elohim’s law, 
</div><div class="q2">I will also forget your children. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me. 
</div><div class="q2">I will change their glory into shame. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>They feed on the sin of my people, 
</div><div class="q2">and set their heart on their iniquity. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>It will be like people, like priest; 
</div><div class="q2">and I will punish them for their ways, 
</div><div class="q2">and will repay them for their deeds. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>They will eat, and not have enough. 
</div><div class="q2">They will play the prostitute, and will not increase; 
</div><div class="q2">because they have abandoned listening to Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding. 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>My people consult with their wooden idol, 
</div><div class="q2">and answer to a stick of wood. 
</div><div class="q1">Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray, 
</div><div class="q2">and they have been unfaithful to their Elohim. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, 
</div><div class="q2">and burn incense on the hills, under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, 
</div><div class="q2">because its shade is good. 
</div><div class="q1">Therefore your daughters play the prostitute, 
</div><div class="q2">and your brides commit adultery. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute, 
</div><div class="q2">nor your brides when they commit adultery; 
</div><div class="q1">because the men consort with prostitutes, 
</div><div class="q2">and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes; 
</div><div class="q2">so the people without understanding will come to ruin. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“Though you, Israel, play the prostitute, 
</div><div class="q2">yet don’t let Judah offend; 
</div><div class="q2">and don’t come to Gilgal, 
</div><div class="q2">neither go up to Beth Aven, 
</div><div class="q2">nor swear, ‘As Yahweh lives.’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. 
</div><div class="q2">Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Ephraim is joined to idols. 
</div><div class="q2">Leave him alone! 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Their drink has become sour. 
</div><div class="q2">They play the prostitute continually. 
</div><div class="q2">Her rulers dearly love their shameful way. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings; 
</div><div class="q2">and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices. 
</div><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“Listen to this, you priests! 
</div><div class="q2">Listen, house of Israel, 
</div><div class="q2">and give ear, house of the king! 
</div><div class="q1">For the judgment is against you;

</div><div class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The rebels are deep in slaughter, 
</div><div class="q2">but I discipline all of them. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>I know Ephraim,

</div><div class="q2">Israel is defiled. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their Elohim, 
</div><div class="q2">for the spirit of prostitution is within them,

</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The pride of Israel testifies to his face. 
</div><div class="q2">Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity. 
</div><div class="q2">Judah also will stumble with them. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">but they won’t find him. 
</div><div class="q2">He has withdrawn himself from them. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They are unfaithful to Yahweh; 
</div><div class="q2">for they have borne illegitimate children. 
</div><div class="q2">Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.

</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke. 
</div><div class="q2">Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark. 
</div><div class="q2">I will pour out my wrath on them like water. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Ephraim is oppressed, 
</div><div class="q2">he is crushed in judgment,

<sup>13&#160;</sup>“When Ephraim saw his sickness,
