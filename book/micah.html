<p class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word that came to Micah of Morasheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Hear, you peoples, all of you! 
</p><p class="q2">Listen, O earth, and all that is therein. 
</p><p class="q1">Let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you, 
</p><p class="q2">the Lord from his set-apart temple. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For behold, Yahweh comes out of his place, 
</p><p class="q2">and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The mountains melt under him, 
</p><p class="q2">and the valleys split apart like wax before the fire, 
</p><p class="q2">like waters that are poured down a steep place. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and for the sins of the house of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">What is the disobedience of Jacob? 
</p><p class="q2">Isn’t it Samaria? 
</p><p class="q1">And what are the high places of Judah? 
</p><p class="q2">Aren’t they Jerusalem? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field, 
</p><p class="q2">like places for planting vineyards; 
</p><p class="q1">and I will pour down its stones into the valley, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will uncover its foundations. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>All her idols will be beaten to pieces, 
</p><p class="q2">all her temple gifts will be burned with fire, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will destroy all her images; 
</p><p class="q1">for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them, 
</p><p class="q2">and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.” 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>For this I will lament and wail. 
</p><p class="q2">I will go stripped and naked. 
</p><p class="q2">I will howl like the jackals 
</p><p class="q2">and mourn like the ostriches. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>For her wounds are incurable; 
</p><p class="q2">for it has come even to Judah. 
</p><p class="q1">It reaches to the gate of my people, 
</p><p class="q2">even to Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Don’t tell it in Gath. 
</p><p class="q2">Don’t weep at all. 
</p><p class="q2">At Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. 
</p><p class="q2">The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out. 
</p><p class="q2">The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, 
</p><p class="q2">because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish. 
</p><p class="q2">She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; 
</p><p class="q2">for the transgressions of Israel were found in you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath. 
</p><p class="q2">The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will yet bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah. 
</p><p class="q2">The glory of Israel will come to Adullam. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Shave your heads, 
</p><p class="q2">and cut off your hair for the children of your delight. 
</p><p class="q1">Enlarge your baldness like the vulture, 
</p><p class="q2">for they have gone into captivity from you! 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Woe to those who devise iniquity 
</p><p class="q2">and work evil on their beds! 
</p><p class="q1">When the morning is light, they practice it, 
</p><p class="q2">because it is in the power of their hand. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>They desire fields and seize them, 
</p><p class="q2">and houses, then take them away. 
</p><p class="q1">They oppress a man and his house, 
</p><p class="q2">even a man and his heritage. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh says: 
</p><p class="q1">“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster, 
</p><p class="q2">from which you will not remove your necks, 
</p><p class="q2">neither will you walk haughtily, 
</p><p class="q2">for it is an evil time. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>In that day they will take up a parable against you, 
</p><p class="q2">and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, 
</p><p class="q2">‘We are utterly ruined! 
</p><p class="q2">My people’s possession is divided up. 
</p><p class="q2">Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’&#160;” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“Don’t prophesy!”—they prophesy—</p><p class="q2">“Don’t prophesy about these things. 
</p><p class="q2">Disgrace won’t overtake us.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">“Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry? 
</p><p class="q2">Are these his doings? 
</p><p class="q2">Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>But lately my people have risen up as an enemy. 
</p><p class="q2">You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; 
</p><p class="q2">from their young children you take away my blessing forever. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Arise, and depart! 
</p><p class="q2">For this is not your resting place, 
</p><p class="q2">because of uncleanness that destroys, 
</p><p class="q2">even with a grievous destruction. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying, 
</p><p class="q2">“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,” 
</p><p class="q2">he would be the prophet of this people. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob. 
</p><p class="q2">I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, 
</p><p class="q2">as a flock in the middle of their pasture. 
</p><p class="q2">They will swarm with people. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He who breaks open the way goes up before them. 
</p><p class="q2">They break through the gate, and go out. 
</p><p class="q2">Their king passes on before them, 
</p><p class="q2">with Yahweh at their head. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>I said, 
</p><p class="q1">“Please listen, you heads of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and rulers of the house of Israel: 
</p><p class="q2">Isn’t it for you to know justice? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>You who hate the good, 
</p><p class="q2">and love the evil; 
</p><p class="q2">who tear off their skin, 
</p><p class="q2">and their flesh from off their bones; 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>who also eat the flesh of my people, 
</p><p class="q2">and peel their skin from off them, 
</p><p class="q2">and break their bones, 
</p><p class="q2">and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, 
</p><p class="q2">and as meat within the cauldron. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then they will cry to Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">but he will not answer them. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, 
</p><p class="q2">because they made their deeds evil.” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray—for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him: 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“Therefore night is over you, with no vision, 
</p><p class="q2">and it is dark to you, that you may not divine; 
</p><p class="q2">and the sun will go down on the prophets, 
</p><p class="q2">and the day will be black over them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The seers shall be disappointed, 
</p><p class="q2">and the diviners confounded. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, they shall all cover their lips, 
</p><p class="q2">for there is no answer from Elohim.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit, 
</p><p class="q2">and of judgment, and of might, 
</p><p class="q2">to declare to Jacob his disobedience, 
</p><p class="q2">and to Israel his sin. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and rulers of the house of Israel, 
</p><p class="q2">who abhor justice, 
</p><p class="q2">and pervert all equity, 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>who build up Zion with blood, 
</p><p class="q2">and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Her leaders judge for bribes, 
</p><p class="q2">and her priests teach for a price, 
</p><p class="q2">and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money; 
</p><p class="q1">yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, 
</p><p class="q2">“Isn’t Yahweh among us? 
</p><p class="q2">No disaster will come on us.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, 
</p><p class="q2">and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, 
</p><p class="q2">and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>But in the latter days, 
</p><p class="q2">it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains, 
</p><p class="q2">and it will be exalted above the hills; 
</p><p class="q2">and peoples will stream to it. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Many nations will go and say, 
</p><p class="q2">“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">and to the house of the Elohim of Jacob; 
</p><p class="q2">and he will teach us of his ways, 
</p><p class="q2">and we will walk in his paths.” 
</p><p class="q1">For the law will go out of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem; 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and he will judge between many peoples, 
</p><p class="q2">and will decide concerning strong nations afar off. 
</p><p class="q2">They will beat their swords into plowshares, 
</p><p class="q2">and their spears into pruning hooks. 
</p><p class="q1">Nation will not lift up sword against nation, 
</p><p class="q2">neither will they learn war any more. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree. 
</p><p class="q2">No one will make them afraid, 
</p><p class="q2">for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their elohims, 
</p><p class="q2">but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our Elohim forever and ever. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“In that day,” says Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">“I will assemble that which is lame, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will gather that which is driven away, 
</p><p class="q2">and that which I have afflicted; 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>and I will make that which was lame a remnant, 
</p><p class="q2">and that which was cast far off a strong nation: 
</p><p class="q2">and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">to you it will come. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, the former dominion will come, 
</p><p class="q2">the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Now why do you cry out aloud? 
</p><p class="q2">Is there no king in you? 
</p><p class="q2">Has your counselor perished, 
</p><p class="q2">that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">like a woman in travail; 
</p><p class="q2">for now you will go out of the city, 
</p><p class="q2">and will dwell in the field, 
</p><p class="q2">and will come even to Babylon. 
</p><p class="q1">There you will be rescued. 
</p><p class="q2">There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Now many nations have assembled against you, that say, 
</p><p class="q2">“Let her be defiled, 
</p><p class="q2">and let our eye gloat over Zion.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">neither do they understand his counsel; 
</p><p class="q2">for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">for I will make your horn iron, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will make your hoofs bronze. 
</p><p class="q1">You will beat in pieces many peoples. 
</p><p class="q1">I will devote their gain to Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth. 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now you shall gather yourself in troops, 
</p><p class="q2">daughter of troops. 
</p><p class="q1">He has laid siege against us. 
</p><p class="q2">They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, 
</p><p class="q2">being small among the clans of Judah, 
</p><p class="q2">out of you one will come out to me who is to be ruler in Israel; 
</p><p class="q2">whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth. 
</p><p class="q2">Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his Elohim. 
</p><p class="q2">They will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land 
</p><p class="q2">and when he marches through our fortresses, 
</p><p class="q2">then we will raise against him seven shepherds, 
</p><p class="q2">and eight leaders of men. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, 
</p><p class="q2">and the land of Nimrod in its gates. 
</p><p class="q1">He will deliver us from the Assyrian, 
</p><p class="q2">when he invades our land, 
</p><p class="q2">and when he marches within our border. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples 
</p><p class="q2">like dew from Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">like showers on the grass, 
</p><p class="q2">that don’t wait for man 
</p><p class="q2">nor wait for the sons of men. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, 
</p><p class="q2">among many peoples, 
</p><p class="q2">like a lion among the animals of the forest, 
</p><p class="q2">like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; 
</p><p class="q2">who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, 
</p><p class="q2">and there is no one to deliver. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, 
</p><p class="q2">and let all of your enemies be cut off. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“It will happen in that day”, says Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">“that I will cut off your horses from among you 
</p><p class="q2">and will destroy your chariots. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>I will cut off the cities of your land 
</p><p class="q2">and will tear down all your strongholds. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will destroy witchcraft from your hand. 
</p><p class="q2">You shall have no soothsayers. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars from among you; 
</p><p class="q2">and you shall no more worship the work of your hands. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will uproot your Asherah poles from among you; 
</p><p class="q2">and I will destroy your cities. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will execute vengeance in anger 
</p><p class="q2">and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Listen now to what Yahweh says: 
</p><p class="q1">“Arise, plead your case before the mountains, 
</p><p class="q2">and let the hills hear what you have to say. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s indictment, 
</p><p class="q2">and you enduring foundations of the earth; 
</p><p class="q2">for Yahweh has a case against his people, 
</p><p class="q2">and he will contend with Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>My people, what have I done to you? 
</p><p class="q2">How have I burdened you? 
</p><p class="q2">Answer me! 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, 
</p><p class="q2">and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. 
</p><p class="q2">I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, 
</p><p class="q2">and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, 
</p><p class="q2">that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.” 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>How shall I come before Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">and bow myself before the exalted Elohim? 
</p><p class="q1">Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, 
</p><p class="q2">with calves a year old? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams? 
</p><p class="q2">With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? 
</p><p class="q1">Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? 
</p><p class="q2">The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>He has shown you, O man, what is good. 
</p><p class="q2">What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly, 
</p><p class="q2">to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your Elohim? 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s voice calls to the city—</p><p class="q2">and wisdom fears your name—</p><p class="q1">“Listen to the rod, 
</p><p class="q2">and he who appointed it. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, 
</p><p class="q2">and a short ephah that is accursed? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Shall I tolerate dishonest scales, 
</p><p class="q2">and a bag of deceitful weights? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Her rich men are full of violence, 
</p><p class="q2">her inhabitants speak lies, 
</p><p class="q2">and their tongue is deceitful in their speech. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound. 
</p><p class="q2">I have made you desolate because of your sins. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>You shall eat, but not be satisfied. 
</p><p class="q2">Your hunger will be within you. 
</p><p class="q2">You will store up, but not save, 
</p><p class="q2">and that which you save I will give up to the sword. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>You will sow, but won’t reap. 
</p><p class="q2">You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; 
</p><p class="q2">and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>For the statutes of Omri are kept, 
</p><p class="q2">and all the works of Ahab’s house. 
</p><p class="q2">You walk in their counsels, 
</p><p class="q2">that I may make you a ruin, 
</p><p class="q2">and your inhabitants a hissing. 
</p><p class="q2">You will bear the reproach of my people.”

<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="7">7</h2>
<p class="q1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Misery is mine! 
</p><p class="q2">Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard. 
</p><p class="q2">There is no cluster of grapes to eat. 
</p><p class="q2">My soul desires to eat the early fig. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The elohimly man has perished out of the earth, 
</p><p class="q2">and there is no one upright among men. 
</p><p class="q2">They all lie in wait for blood; 
</p><p class="q2">every man hunts his brother with a net. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. 
</p><p class="q2">The ruler and judge ask for a bribe. 
</p><p class="q1">The powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul. 
</p><p class="q2">Thus they conspire together. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The best of them is like a brier. 
</p><p class="q2">The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. 
</p><p class="q1">The day of your watchmen, 
</p><p class="q2">even your visitation, has come; 
</p><p class="q2">now is the time of their confusion. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Don’t trust in a neighbor. 
</p><p class="q2">Don’t put confidence in a friend. 
</p><p class="q2">With the woman lying in your embrace, 
</p><p class="q2">be careful of the words of your mouth! 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>For the son dishonors the father, 
</p><p class="q2">the daughter rises up against her mother, 
</p><p class="q2">the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 
</p><p class="q2">a man’s enemies are the men of his own house. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But as for me, I will look to Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q2">I will wait for the Elohim of my salvation. 
</p><p class="q2">My Elohim will hear me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy. 
</p><p class="q2">When I fall, I will arise. 
</p><p class="q2">When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">because I have sinned against him, 
</p><p class="q2">until he pleads my case and executes judgment for me. 
</p><p class="q2">He will bring me out to the light. 
</p><p class="q2">I will see his righteousness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then my enemy will see it, 
</p><p class="q2">and shame will cover her who said to me, 
</p><p class="q2">“Where is Yahweh your Elohim?” 
</p><p class="q1">My eyes will see her. 
</p><p class="q2">Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>A day to build your walls! 
</p><p class="q2">In that day, he will extend your boundary. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, 
</p><p class="q2">and from Egypt even to the River, 
</p><p class="q2">and from sea to sea, 
</p><p class="q2">and mountain to mountain. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein, 
</p><p class="q2">for the fruit of their doings. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Shepherd your people with your staff, 
</p><p class="q2">the flock of your heritage, 
</p><p class="q2">who dwell by themselves in a forest. 
</p><p class="q1">Let them feed in the middle of fertile pasture land, 
</p><p class="q2">in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt, 
</p><p class="q2">I will show them marvelous things.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might. 
</p><p class="q2">They will lay their hand on their mouth. 
</p><p class="q2">Their ears will be deaf. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>They will lick the dust like a serpent. 
</p><p class="q2">Like crawling things of the earth, they will come trembling out of their dens. 
</p><p class="q2">They will come with fear to Yahweh our Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">and will be afraid because of you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Who is an Elohim like you, who pardons iniquity, 
</p><p class="q2">and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? 
</p><p class="q1">He doesn’t retain his anger forever, 
</p><p class="q2">because he delights in loving kindness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>He will again have compassion on us. 
</p><p class="q2">He will tread our iniquities under foot. 
</p><p class="q2">You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>You will give truth to Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and mercy to Abraham, 
</p><p class="q2">as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old. </p></div><script src="../main.js"></script></body></html>
