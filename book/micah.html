<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Yehovah’s<span class="f">+ \fr 1:1 \ft “Yehovah” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> word that came to Micah of Morasheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Hear, you peoples, all of you! 
</p><p class="q2">Listen, O earth, and all that is therein. 
</p><p class="q1">Let the Lord<span class="f">+ \fr 1:2 \ft The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span> Yehovah be witness against you, 
</p><p class="q2">the Lord from his set-apart temple. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>For behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:3 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> Yehovah comes out of his place, 
</p><p class="q2">and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>The mountains melt under him, 
</p><p class="q2">and the valleys split apart like wax before the fire, 
</p><p class="q2">like waters that are poured down a steep place. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>“All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and for the sins of the house of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">What is the disobedience of Jacob? 
</p><p class="q2">Isn’t it Samaria? 
</p><p class="q1">And what are the high places of Judah? 
</p><p class="q2">Aren’t they Jerusalem? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field, 
</p><p class="q2">like places for planting vineyards; 
</p><p class="q1">and I will pour down its stones into the valley, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will uncover its foundations. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>All her idols will be beaten to pieces, 
</p><p class="q2">all her temple gifts will be burned with fire, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will destroy all her images; 
</p><p class="q1">for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them, 
</p><p class="q2">and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.” 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>For this I will lament and wail. 
</p><p class="q2">I will go stripped and naked. 
</p><p class="q2">I will howl like the jackals 
</p><p class="q2">and mourn like the ostriches. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>For her wounds are incurable; 
</p><p class="q2">for it has come even to Judah. 
</p><p class="q1">It reaches to the gate of my people, 
</p><p class="q2">even to Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Don’t tell it in Gath. 
</p><p class="q2">Don’t weep at all. 
</p><p class="q2">At Beth Ophrah<span class="f">+ \fr 1:10 \ft Beth Ophrah means literally “House of Dust.”</span> I have rolled myself in the dust. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. 
</p><p class="q2">The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out. 
</p><p class="q2">The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, 
</p><p class="q2">because evil has come down from Yehovah to the gate of Jerusalem. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish. 
</p><p class="q2">She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; 
</p><p class="q2">for the transgressions of Israel were found in you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath. 
</p><p class="q2">The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>I will yet bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah. 
</p><p class="q2">The glory of Israel will come to Adullam. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Shave your heads, 
</p><p class="q2">and cut off your hair for the children of your delight. 
</p><p class="q1">Enlarge your baldness like the vulture, 
</p><p class="q2">for they have gone into captivity from you! 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Woe to those who devise iniquity 
</p><p class="q2">and work evil on their beds! 
</p><p class="q1">When the morning is light, they practice it, 
</p><p class="q2">because it is in the power of their hand. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>They covet fields and seize them, 
</p><p class="q2">and houses, then take them away. 
</p><p class="q1">They oppress a man and his house, 
</p><p class="q2">even a man and his heritage. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Therefore Yehovah says: 
</p><p class="q1">“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster, 
</p><p class="q2">from which you will not remove your necks, 
</p><p class="q2">neither will you walk haughtily, 
</p><p class="q2">for it is an evil time. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>In that day they will take up a parable against you, 
</p><p class="q2">and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, 
</p><p class="q2">‘We are utterly ruined! 
</p><p class="q2">My people’s possession is divided up. 
</p><p class="q2">Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’&#160;” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yehovah’s assembly. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“Don’t prophesy!”—they prophesy—</p><p class="q2">“Don’t prophesy about these things. 
</p><p class="q2">Disgrace won’t overtake us.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">“Is Yehovah’s Spirit angry? 
</p><p class="q2">Are these his doings? 
</p><p class="q2">Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>But lately my people have risen up as an enemy. 
</p><p class="q2">You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; 
</p><p class="q2">from their young children you take away my blessing forever. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Arise, and depart! 
</p><p class="q2">For this is not your resting place, 
</p><p class="q2">because of uncleanness that destroys, 
</p><p class="q2">even with a grievous destruction. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying, 
</p><p class="q2">“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,” 
</p><p class="q2">he would be the prophet of this people. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob. 
</p><p class="q2">I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. 
</p><p class="q1">I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, 
</p><p class="q2">as a flock in the middle of their pasture. 
</p><p class="q2">They will swarm with people. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He who breaks open the way goes up before them. 
</p><p class="q2">They break through the gate, and go out. 
</p><p class="q2">Their king passes on before them, 
</p><p class="q2">with Yehovah at their head. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>I said, 
</p><p class="q1">“Please listen, you heads of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and rulers of the house of Israel: 
</p><p class="q2">Isn’t it for you to know justice? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>You who hate the good, 
</p><p class="q2">and love the evil; 
</p><p class="q2">who tear off their skin, 
</p><p class="q2">and their flesh from off their bones; 
</p><p class="q2">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>who also eat the flesh of my people, 
</p><p class="q2">and peel their skin from off them, 
</p><p class="q2">and break their bones, 
</p><p class="q2">and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, 
</p><p class="q2">and as meat within the cauldron. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Then they will cry to Yehovah, 
</p><p class="q2">but he will not answer them. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, 
</p><p class="q2">because they made their deeds evil.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Yehovah says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray—for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him: 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“Therefore night is over you, with no vision, 
</p><p class="q2">and it is dark to you, that you may not divine; 
</p><p class="q2">and the sun will go down on the prophets, 
</p><p class="q2">and the day will be black over them. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The seers shall be disappointed, 
</p><p class="q2">and the diviners confounded. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, they shall all cover their lips, 
</p><p class="q2">for there is no answer from Elohim.”<span class="f">+ \fr 3:7 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>But as for me, I am full of power by Yehovah’s Spirit, 
</p><p class="q2">and of judgment, and of might, 
</p><p class="q2">to declare to Jacob his disobedience, 
</p><p class="q2">and to Israel his sin. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and rulers of the house of Israel, 
</p><p class="q2">who abhor justice, 
</p><p class="q2">and pervert all equity, 
</p><p class="q2">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>who build up Zion with blood, 
</p><p class="q2">and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Her leaders judge for bribes, 
</p><p class="q2">and her priests teach for a price, 
</p><p class="q2">and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money; 
</p><p class="q1">yet they lean on Yehovah, and say, 
</p><p class="q2">“Isn’t Yehovah among us? 
</p><p class="q2">No disaster will come on us.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, 
</p><p class="q2">and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, 
</p><p class="q2">and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>But in the latter days, 
</p><p class="q2">it will happen that the mountain of Yehovah’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains, 
</p><p class="q2">and it will be exalted above the hills; 
</p><p class="q2">and peoples will stream to it. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Many nations will go and say, 
</p><p class="q2">“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yehovah, 
</p><p class="q2">and to the house of the Elohim of Jacob; 
</p><p class="q2">and he will teach us of his ways, 
</p><p class="q2">and we will walk in his paths.” 
</p><p class="q1">For the law will go out of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">and Yehovah’s word from Jerusalem; 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>and he will judge between many peoples, 
</p><p class="q2">and will decide concerning strong nations afar off. 
</p><p class="q2">They will beat their swords into plowshares,

<span class="v">4&#160;</span>But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree. 
</p><p class="q2">No one will make them afraid, 
</p><p class="q2">for the mouth of Yehovah of Armies has spoken. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their elohims, 
</p><p class="q2">but we will walk in the name of Yehovah our Elohim forever and ever. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“In that day,” says Yehovah, 
</p><p class="q2">“I will assemble that which is lame, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will gather that which is driven away, 
</p><p class="q2">and that which I have afflicted;

<span class="v">7&#160;</span>and I will make that which was lame a remnant,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">to you it will come. 
</p><p class="q1">Yes, the former dominion will come,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>But they don’t know the thoughts of Yehovah, 
</p><p class="q2">neither do they understand his counsel; 
</p><p class="q2">for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, 
</p><p class="q2">for I will make your horn iron, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will make your hoofs bronze. 
</p><p class="q1">You will beat in pieces many peoples.

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Misery is mine! 
</p><p class="q2">Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard. 
</p><p class="q2">There is no cluster of grapes to eat. 
</p><p class="q2">My soul desires to eat the early fig. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>The elohimly man has perished out of the earth, 
</p><p class="q2">and there is no one upright among men. 
</p><p class="q2">They all lie in wait for blood; 
</p><p class="q2">every man hunts his brother with a net. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. 
</p><p class="q2">The ruler and judge ask for a bribe. 
</p><p class="q1">The powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul. 
</p><p class="q2">Thus they conspire together. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>The best of them is like a brier. 
</p><p class="q2">The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. 
</p><p class="q1">The day of your watchmen, 
</p><p class="q2">even your visitation, has come; 
</p><p class="q2">now is the time of their confusion. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Don’t trust in a neighbor. 
</p><p class="q2">Don’t put confidence in a friend. 
</p><p class="q2">With the woman lying in your embrace, 
</p><p class="q2">be careful of the words of your mouth! 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For the son dishonors the father, 
</p><p class="q2">the daughter rises up against her mother, 
</p><p class="q2">the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 
</p><p class="q2">a man’s enemies are the men of his own house. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>But as for me, I will look to Yehovah. 
</p><p class="q2">I will wait for the Elohim of my salvation. 
</p><p class="q2">My Elohim will hear me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy. 
</p><p class="q2">When I fall, I will arise. 
</p><p class="q2">When I sit in darkness, Yehovah will be a light to me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>I will bear the indignation of Yehovah, 
</p><p class="q2">because I have sinned against him, 
</p><p class="q2">until he pleads my case and executes judgment for me. 
</p><p class="q2">He will bring me out to the light. 
</p><p class="q2">I will see his righteousness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Then my enemy will see it, 
</p><p class="q2">and shame will cover her who said to me, 
</p><p class="q2">“Where is Yehovah your Elohim?” 
</p><p class="q1">My eyes will see her. 
</p><p class="q2">Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>A day to build your walls! 
</p><p class="q2">In that day, he will extend your boundary. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, 
</p><p class="q2">and from Egypt even to the River,

</p><p class="q2">and mountain to mountain.

<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Shepherd your people with your staff, 
</p><p class="q2">the flock of your heritage, 
</p><p class="q2">who dwell by themselves in a forest. 
</p><p class="q1">Let them feed in the middle of fertile pasture land, 
</p><p class="q2">in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt, 
</p><p class="q2">I will show them marvelous things.” 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might. 
</p><p class="q2">They will lay their hand on their mouth. 
</p><p class="q2">Their ears will be deaf. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>They will lick the dust like a serpent. 
</p><p class="q2">Like crawling things of the earth, they will come trembling out of their dens. 
</p><p class="q2">They will come with fear to Yehovah our Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">and will be afraid because of you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Who is an Elohim like you, who pardons iniquity, 
</p><p class="q2">and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? 
</p><p class="q1">He doesn’t retain his anger forever, 
</p><p class="q2">because he delights in loving kindness. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>He will again have compassion on us. 
</p><p class="q2">He will tread our iniquities under foot. 
</p><p class="q2">You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>You will give truth to Jacob, 
</p><p class="q2">and mercy to Abraham, 
</p><p class="q2">as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old. </p></div></body></html>
