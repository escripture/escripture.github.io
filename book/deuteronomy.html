<div class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them, 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying, 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“Yahweh our Elohim spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ‘You have lived long enough at this mountain. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Behold, after them.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yahweh your Elohim has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>May Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you! 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife? 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Take wise men of understanding who are respected among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.” 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Elohim’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.” 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our Elohim commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our Elohim gives to us. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Behold, Yahweh your Elohim has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh the Elohim of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our Elohim gives to us.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your Elohim. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Yahweh your Elohim, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>and in the wilderness where you have seen how that Yahweh your Elohim carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your Elohim, 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Yahweh heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying, 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers, 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>37&#160;</sup>Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it. 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>41&#160;</sup>Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our Elohim commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>42&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>43&#160;</sup>So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. 
<sup>44&#160;</sup>The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. 
<sup>45&#160;</sup>You returned and wept before Yahweh, but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you. 
<sup>46&#160;</sup>So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>“You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>For Yahweh your Elohim has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh your Elohim has been with you. You have lacked nothing. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>(The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.) 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“Now rise up and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahweh’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>(That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place, 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>“Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>“Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet, 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our Elohim gives us.” 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for Yahweh your Elohim hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.” 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>Yahweh our Elohim delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken. 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh our Elohim delivered up all before us. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our Elohim forbade us. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>So Yahweh our Elohim also delivered into our hand Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages without walls. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a man.) 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites; 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.) 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I gave Gilead to Machir. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I commanded you at that time, saying, “Yahweh your Elohim has given you this land to possess it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Israel. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>But your women, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own possession, which I have given you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your Elohim has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your Elohim himself fights for you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>I begged Yahweh at that time, saying, 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>“Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what elohim is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours? 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>But Yahweh was angry with me because of you, and didn’t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, “That is enough! Speak no more to me of this matter. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.” 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach you, to do them, that you may live and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, gives you. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim which I command you. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for Yahweh your Elohim has destroyed all the men who followed Baal Peor from among you. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>But you who were faithful to Yahweh your Elohim are all alive today. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my Elohim commanded me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in to possess it. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>For what great nation is there that has an elohim so near to them as Yahweh our Elohim is whenever we call on him? 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which I set before you today? 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children—<sup>10&#160;</sup>the day that you stood before Yahweh your Elohim in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.” 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your Elohim has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you for an inheritance; 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over and possess that good land. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your Elohim, which he made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your Elohim has forbidden you. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>For Yahweh your Elohim is a devouring fire, a jealous Elohim. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>When you father children and children’s children, and you have been long in the land, and then corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in Yahweh your Elohim’s sight to provoke him to anger, 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where Yahweh will lead you away. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>There you will serve elohims, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>But from there you shall seek Yahweh your Elohim, and you will find him when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your Elohim and listen to his voice. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>For Yahweh your Elohim is a merciful Elohim. He will not fail you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them. 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that Elohim created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as great as this thing is, or has been heard like it? 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>Did a people ever hear the voice of Elohim speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Or has Elohim tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your Elohim did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is Elohim. There is no one else besides him. 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh himself is Elohim in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else. 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>You shall keep his statutes and his commandments which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you for all time.

<sup>41&#160;</sup>Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise,

<sup>43&#160;</sup>Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>44&#160;</sup>This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.

<sup>46&#160;</sup>beyond the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck when they came out of Egypt. 
<sup>47&#160;</sup>They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; 
<sup>48&#160;</sup>from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Zion (also called Hermon),

<sup>1&#160;</sup>When Yahweh your Elohim brings you into the land where you go to possess it, and casts out many nations before you—the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—seven nations greater and mightier than you; 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and when Yahweh your Elohim delivers them up before you, and you strike them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>You shall not make yourself a relative of them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For that would turn away your sons from following me, that they may serve other elohims. So Yahweh’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>For you are a set-apart people to Yahweh your Elohim. Yahweh your Elohim has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Yahweh didn’t set his love on you nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples; 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>but because Yahweh loves you, and because he desires to keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Know therefore that Yahweh your Elohim himself is Elohim, the faithful Elohim, who keeps covenant and loving kindness to a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which I command you today, to do them. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances and keep and do them, that Yahweh your Elohim will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>You will be blessed above all peoples. There won’t be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and he will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your Elohim shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them. You shall not serve their elohims; for that would be a snare to you. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?” 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what Yahweh your Elohim did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your Elohim brought you out. So shall Yahweh your Elohim do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahweh your Elohim will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your Elohim is among you, a great and awesome Elohim. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Yahweh your Elohim will cast out those nations before you little by little. You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>But Yahweh your Elohim will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>You shall burn the engraved images of their elohims with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your Elohim. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>You shall not bring an abomination into your house and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you today, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.

<sup>9&#160;</sup>a land in which you shall eat bread without scarcity, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.

<sup>13&#160;</sup>and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with venomous snakes and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint; 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end; 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.” 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>But you shall remember Yahweh your Elohim, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is today. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your Elohim, and walk after other elohims, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you shall surely perish.

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Know therefore today that Yahweh your Elohim is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your Elohim has thrust them out from before you, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;” because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your Elohim does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Know therefore that Yahweh your Elohim doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your Elohim to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with Elohim’s finger. On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned away from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image for themselves!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your Elohim. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which Yahweh had commanded you. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to wrath. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your Elohim, and you didn’t believe him or listen to his voice. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin, 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’ 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="10">10</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>At that time Yahweh said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.” 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly; and Yahweh gave them to me. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your Elohim spoke to him.) 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and Yahweh listened to me that time also. Yahweh would not destroy you. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your Elohim require of you, but to fear Yahweh your Elohim, to walk in all his ways, to love him, and to serve Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart and with all your soul, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>to keep Yahweh’s commandments and statutes, which I command you today for your good? 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Behold, to Yahweh your Elohim belongs heaven, the heaven of heavens, and the earth, with all that is therein. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their offspring after them, even you above all peoples, as it is today. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>For Yahweh your Elohim, he is Elohim of elohims and Lord of lords, the great Elohim, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons or take bribes. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>He executes justice for the fatherless and widow and loves the foreigner in giving him food and clothing. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Therefore love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>You shall fear Yahweh your Elohim. You shall serve him. You shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>He is your praise, and he is your Elohim, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your Elohim has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="11">11</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Therefore you shall love Yahweh your Elohim, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Know this day—for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your Elohim, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day; 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>and what he did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place; 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben—how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel; 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Therefore you shall keep the entire commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land that you go over to possess; 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>and that you may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>For the land, where you go in to possess isn’t like the land of Egypt that you came out of, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>but the land that you go over to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>a land which Yahweh your Elohim cares for. Yahweh your Elohim’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you today, to love Yahweh your Elohim, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>that I will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away to serve other elohims and worship them; 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>and Yahweh’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky so that there is no rain, and the land doesn’t yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates; 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>that your days and your children’s days may be multiplied in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you—to do them, to love Yahweh your Elohim, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him—<sup>23&#160;</sup>then Yahweh will drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>No man will be able to stand before you. Yahweh your Elohim will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse: 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim, which I command you today; 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim, but turn away out of the way which I command you today, to go after other elohims which you have not known. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>It shall happen, when Yahweh your Elohim brings you into the land that you go to possess, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it. 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you today.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, has given you to possess all the days that you live on the earth.

<sup>3&#160;</sup>You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and burn their Asherah poles with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images of their elohims. You shall destroy their name out of that place. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>You shall not do so to Yahweh your Elohim. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But to the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, you shall seek his habitation, and you shall come there. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>You shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock there.

<sup>12&#160;</sup>You shall rejoice before Yahweh your Elohim—you, and your sons, your daughters, your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;

<sup>29&#160;</sup>When Yahweh your Elohim cuts off the nations from before you where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,

<sup>3&#160;</sup>You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land which Yahweh your Elohim causes you to inherit into three parts, that every man slayer may flee there. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him in time past—<sup>5&#160;</sup>as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood and his hand swings the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and hits his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and live. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer while hot anger is in his heart and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally, even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>If Yahweh your Elohim enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;

<sup>65&#160;</sup>Among these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and pining of soul. 
<sup>66&#160;</sup>Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life. 
<sup>67&#160;</sup>In the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening you will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see. 
<sup>68&#160;</sup>Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I told to you that you would never see it again. There you will offer yourselves to your enemies for male and female slaves, and nobody will buy you.

<sup>18&#160;</sup>lest there should be among you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away today from Yahweh our Elohim, to go to serve the elohims of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison; 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” to destroy the moist with the dry. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Yahweh will not pardon him, but then Yahweh’s anger and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will fall on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yahweh will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>The generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick, 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the Elohim of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>and went and served other elohims and worshiped them, elohims that they didn’t know and that he had not given to them. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>The secret things belong to Yahweh our Elohim; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations where Yahweh your Elohim has driven you,

<sup>11&#160;</sup>For this commandment which I command you today is not too hard for you or too distant. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>For I command you today to love Yahweh your Elohim, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your Elohim may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away and worship other elohims, and serve them, 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants, 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>to love Yahweh your Elohim, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days, that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>He said to them, “I am one hundred twenty years old today. I can no more go out and come in. Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’ 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahweh your Elohim himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them, for Yahweh your Elohim himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Yahweh himself is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be discouraged.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your Elohim in the place which he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, learn, fear Yahweh your Elohim, and observe to do all the words of this law, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>and that their children, who have not known, may hear and learn to fear Yahweh your Elohim, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.” 
</div><div class="p">Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up and play the prostitute after the strange elohims of the land where they go to be among them, and will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our Elohim is not among us?’ 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other elohims. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then they will turn to other elohims, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I promised them.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

<sup>26&#160;</sup>“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh your Elohim’s covenant, that it may be there for a witness against you. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. How much more after my death? 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn away from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days, because you will do that which is evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.

<sup>13&#160;</sup>He made him ride on the high places of the earth. 
</div><div class="q2">He ate the increase of the field.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead to Dan, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the Western Sea, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and the south, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to Yahweh’s word. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where his tomb is to this day. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his strength gone. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. The children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Since then, there has not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>in all the signs and the wonders which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds, which Moses did in the sight of all Israel. </div></div><script src="../main.js"></script></body></html>
