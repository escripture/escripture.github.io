<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="1">1</h2>
<p class="p1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh<span class="f">+ \fr 1:3 \ft “Yahweh” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> had given him in commandment to them, 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying, 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“Yahweh our Elohim<span class="f">+ \fr 1:6 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ‘You have lived long enough at this mountain. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:8 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers—to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give to them and to their offspring<span class="f">+ \fr 1:8 \ft or, seed</span> after them.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>May Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you! 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife? 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Take wise men of understanding who are respected among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.” 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Elohim’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.” 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our Elohim commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our Elohim gives to us. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Behold, Yahweh your Elohim has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh the Elohim of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our Elohim gives to us.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your Elohim. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>and in the wilderness where you have seen how that Yahweh your Elohim carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your Elohim, 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>Yahweh heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying, 
<span class="v">35&#160;</span>“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers, 
<span class="v">36&#160;</span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">37&#160;</span>Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there. 
<span class="v">38&#160;</span>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
<span class="v">39&#160;</span>Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it. 
<span class="v">40&#160;</span>But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">41&#160;</span>Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our Elohim commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">42&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">43&#160;</span>So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. 
<span class="v">44&#160;</span>The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. 
<span class="v">45&#160;</span>You returned and wept before Yahweh, but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you. 
<span class="v">46&#160;</span>So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>“You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>For Yahweh your Elohim has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh your Elohim has been with you. You have lacked nothing. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>(The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.) 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>“Now rise up and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Moreover Yahweh’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>“You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>(That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place, 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) 
</p><p>
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>“Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>“Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet, 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our Elohim gives us.” 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for Yahweh your Elohim hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.” 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>Yahweh our Elohim delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people. 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining. 
<span class="v">35&#160;</span>Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken. 
<span class="v">36&#160;</span>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh our Elohim delivered up all before us. 
<span class="v">37&#160;</span>Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our Elohim forbade us. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>So Yahweh our Elohim also delivered into our hand Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages without walls. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits<span class="f">+ \fr 3:11 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</span> was its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a man.) 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites; 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.) 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>I gave Gilead to Machir. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>I commanded you at that time, saying, “Yahweh your Elohim has given you this land to possess it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Israel. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>But your women, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own possession, which I have given you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your Elohim has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your Elohim himself fights for you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>I begged Yahweh at that time, saying, 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>“Lord<span class="f">+ \fr 3:24 \ft The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span> Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what elohim is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours? 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>But Yahweh was angry with me because of you, and didn’t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, “That is enough! Speak no more to me of this matter. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.” 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach you, to do them, that you may live and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, gives you. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim which I command you. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for Yahweh your Elohim has destroyed all the men who followed Baal Peor from among you. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>But you who were faithful to Yahweh your Elohim are all alive today. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my Elohim commanded me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in to possess it. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>For what great nation is there that has an elohim so near to them as Yahweh our Elohim is whenever we call on him? 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which I set before you today? 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children—<span class="v">10&#160;</span>the day that you stood before Yahweh your Elohim in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.” 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your Elohim has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you for an inheritance; 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over and possess that good land. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your Elohim, which he made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your Elohim has forbidden you. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>For Yahweh your Elohim is a devouring fire, a jealous Elohim. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>When you father children and children’s children, and you have been long in the land, and then corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in Yahweh your Elohim’s sight to provoke him to anger, 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where Yahweh will lead you away. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>There you will serve elohims, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>But from there you shall seek Yahweh your Elohim, and you will find him when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your Elohim and listen to his voice. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>For Yahweh your Elohim is a merciful Elohim. He will not fail you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that Elohim created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as great as this thing is, or has been heard like it? 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>Did a people ever hear the voice of Elohim speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>Or has Elohim tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your Elohim did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 
<span class="v">35&#160;</span>It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is Elohim. There is no one else besides him. 
<span class="v">36&#160;</span>Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire. 
<span class="v">37&#160;</span>Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
<span class="v">38&#160;</span>to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today. 
<span class="v">39&#160;</span>Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh himself is Elohim in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else. 
<span class="v">40&#160;</span>You shall keep his statutes and his commandments which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you for all time. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">41&#160;</span>Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, 
<span class="v">42&#160;</span>that the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally and didn’t hate him in time past, and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 
<span class="v">43&#160;</span>Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">44&#160;</span>This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel. 
<span class="v">45&#160;</span>These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt, 
<span class="v">46&#160;</span>beyond the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck when they came out of Egypt. 
<span class="v">47&#160;</span>They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; 
<span class="v">48&#160;</span>from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Zion (also called Hermon), 
<span class="v">49&#160;</span>and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears today, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.” 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Yahweh our Elohim made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Yahweh didn’t make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive today. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the middle of the fire, 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>(I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you Yahweh’s word; for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn’t go up onto the mountain) saying, 
</p><p class="m">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>“I am Yahweh your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>“You shall have no other elohims before me. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>“You shall not make a carved image for yourself—any likeness of what is in heaven above, or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your Elohim, am a jealous Elohim, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>“You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your Elohim;<span class="f">+ \fr 5:11 \ft or, You shall not take the name of Yahweh your Elohim in vain;</span> for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who misuses his name. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>“Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it set-apart, as Yahweh your Elohim commanded you. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>You shall labor six days, and do all your work; 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your Elohim, in which you shall not do any work—neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your Elohim brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. Therefore Yahweh your Elohim commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>“Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your Elohim commanded you, that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>“You shall not murder. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>“You shall not commit adultery. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>“You shall not steal. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>“You shall not covet your neighbor’s woman. Neither shall you desire your neighbor’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke these words to all your assembly on the mountain out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice. He added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>When you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>and you said, “Behold, Yahweh our Elohim has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire. We have seen today that Elohim does speak with man, and he lives. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear Yahweh our Elohim’s voice any more, then we shall die. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living Elohim speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Go near, and hear all that Yahweh our Elohim shall say, and tell us all that Yahweh our Elohim tells you; and we will hear it, and do it.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Yahweh heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, “I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have well said all that they have spoken. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their children forever! 
</p><p>
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>“Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.’ 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your Elohim has commanded you. You shall not turn away to the right hand or to the left. 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your Elohim has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your Elohim commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land that you go over to possess; 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>that you might fear Yahweh your Elohim, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you—you, your son, and your son’s son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our Elohim. Yahweh is one. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>You shall love Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>These words, which I command you today, shall be on your heart; 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>It shall be, when Yahweh your Elohim brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities which you didn’t build, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>and houses full of all good things which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug out which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees which you didn’t plant, and you shall eat and be full; 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>You shall fear Yahweh your Elohim; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his name. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>You shall not go after other elohims, of the elohims of the peoples who are around you, 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>for Yahweh your Elohim among you is a jealous Elohim, lest the anger of Yahweh your Elohim be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>You shall not tempt Yahweh your Elohim, as you tempted him in Massah. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>You shall do that which is right and good in Yahweh’s sight, that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>When your son asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our Elohim has commanded you mean?” 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>then you shall tell your son, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand; 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes; 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our Elohim, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as we are today. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all these commandments before Yahweh our Elohim, as he has commanded us.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="7">7</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>When Yahweh your Elohim brings you into the land where you go to possess it, and casts out many nations before you—the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—seven nations greater and mightier than you; 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>and when Yahweh your Elohim delivers them up before you, and you strike them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>You shall not make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>For that would turn away your sons from following me, that they may serve other elohims. So Yahweh’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For you are a set-apart people to Yahweh your Elohim. Yahweh your Elohim has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Yahweh didn’t set his love on you nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples; 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>but because Yahweh loves you, and because he desires to keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Know therefore that Yahweh your Elohim himself is Elohim, the faithful Elohim, who keeps covenant and loving kindness to a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which I command you today, to do them. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances and keep and do them, that Yahweh your Elohim will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>You will be blessed above all peoples. There won’t be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and he will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your Elohim shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them. You shall not serve their elohims; for that would be a snare to you. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?” 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what Yahweh your Elohim did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your Elohim brought you out. So shall Yahweh your Elohim do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Moreover Yahweh your Elohim will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your Elohim is among you, a great and awesome Elohim. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim will cast out those nations before you little by little. You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>But Yahweh your Elohim will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>You shall burn the engraved images of their elohims with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your Elohim. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>You shall not bring an abomination into your house and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you today, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your Elohim has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>He humbled you, allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know, that he might teach you that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of Yahweh’s mouth. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Your clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh your Elohim disciplines you. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>For Yahweh your Elohim brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills; 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey; 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>a land in which you shall eat bread without scarcity, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your Elohim for the good land which he has given you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Beware lest you forget Yahweh your Elohim, in not keeping his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you today; 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built fine houses and lived in them; 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with venomous snakes and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint; 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.” 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>But you shall remember Yahweh your Elohim, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is today. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your Elohim, and walk after other elohims, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you shall surely perish. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish, because you wouldn’t listen to Yahweh your Elohim’s voice. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="9">9</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky, 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Know therefore today that Yahweh your Elohim is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your Elohim has thrust them out from before you, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;” because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your Elohim does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Know therefore that Yahweh your Elohim doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your Elohim to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with Elohim’s finger. On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned away from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image for themselves!” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your Elohim. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which Yahweh had commanded you. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to wrath. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your Elohim, and you didn’t believe him or listen to his voice. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin, 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’ 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="10">10</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>At that time Yahweh said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.” 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly; and Yahweh gave them to me. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your Elohim spoke to him.) 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and Yahweh listened to me that time also. Yahweh would not destroy you. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your Elohim require of you, but to fear Yahweh your Elohim, to walk in all his ways, to love him, and to serve Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart and with all your soul, 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>to keep Yahweh’s commandments and statutes, which I command you today for your good? 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Behold, to Yahweh your Elohim belongs heaven, the heaven of heavens, and the earth, with all that is therein. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their offspring after them, even you above all peoples, as it is today. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>For Yahweh your Elohim, he is Elohim of elohims and Lord of lords, the great Elohim, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons or take bribes. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>He executes justice for the fatherless and widow and loves the foreigner in giving him food and clothing. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Therefore love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>You shall fear Yahweh your Elohim. You shall serve him. You shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>He is your praise, and he is your Elohim, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your Elohim has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="11">11</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Therefore you shall love Yahweh your Elohim, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Know this day—for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your Elohim, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm, 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day; 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>and what he did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place; 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben—how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel; 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Therefore you shall keep the entire commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land that you go over to possess; 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>and that you may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>For the land, where you go in to possess isn’t like the land of Egypt that you came out of, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>but the land that you go over to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>a land which Yahweh your Elohim cares for. Yahweh your Elohim’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you today, to love Yahweh your Elohim, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>that I will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away to serve other elohims and worship them; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>and Yahweh’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky so that there is no rain, and the land doesn’t yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates; 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>that your days and your children’s days may be multiplied in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you—to do them, to love Yahweh your Elohim, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him—<span class="v">23&#160;</span>then Yahweh will drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>No man will be able to stand before you. Yahweh your Elohim will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse: 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim, which I command you today; 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your Elohim, but turn away out of the way which I command you today, to go after other elohims which you have not known. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>It shall happen, when Yahweh your Elohim brings you into the land that you go to possess, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you today. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="12">12</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh, the Elohim of your fathers, has given you to possess all the days that you live on the earth. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their elohims: on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and burn their Asherah poles with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images of their elohims. You shall destroy their name out of that place. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>You shall not do so to Yahweh your Elohim. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>But to the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, you shall seek his habitation, and you shall come there. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>You shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock there. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>There you shall eat before Yahweh your Elohim, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which Yahweh your Elohim has blessed you. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>You shall not do all the things that we do here today, every man whatever is right in his own eyes; 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>for you haven’t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which Yahweh your Elohim gives you. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which Yahweh your Elohim causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>You shall rejoice before Yahweh your Elohim—you, and your sons, your daughters, your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see; 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>but in the place which Yahweh chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Yet you may kill and eat meat within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to Yahweh your Elohim’s blessing which he has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the deer. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Only you shall not eat the blood. You shall pour it out on the earth like water. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your free will offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand; 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>but you shall eat them before Yahweh your Elohim in the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates. You shall rejoice before Yahweh your Elohim in all that you put your hand to. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Be careful that you don’t forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>When Yahweh your Elohim enlarges your border, as he has promised you, and you say, “I want to eat meat,” because your soul desires to eat meat, you may eat meat, after all the desire of your soul. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>If the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose to put his name is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so you shall eat of it. The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Only be sure that you don’t eat the blood; for the blood is the life. You shall not eat the life with the meat. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>You shall not eat it. You shall pour it out on the earth like water. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do that which is right in Yahweh’s eyes. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Only your set-apart things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>You shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on Yahweh your Elohim’s altar. The blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on Yahweh your Elohim’s altar, and you shall eat the meat. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in Yahweh your Elohim’s eyes. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>When Yahweh your Elohim cuts off the nations from before you where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land, 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them after they are destroyed from before you, and that you not inquire after their elohims, saying, “How do these nations serve their elohims? I will do likewise.” 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>You shall not do so to Yahweh your Elohim; for every abomination to Yahweh, which he hates, they have done to their elohims; for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their elohims. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Whatever thing I command you, that you shall observe to do. You shall not add to it, nor take away from it. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="13">13</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you, and he gives you a sign or a wonder, 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, “Let’s go after other elohims” (which you have not known) “and let’s serve them,” 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your Elohim is testing you, to know whether you love Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart and with all your soul. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>You shall walk after Yahweh your Elohim, fear him, keep his commandments, and obey his voice. You shall serve him, and cling to him. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which Yahweh your Elohim commanded you to walk in. So you shall remove the evil from among you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the woman of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, “Let’s go and serve other elohims”—which you have not known, you, nor your fathers; 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>of the elohims of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth—<span class="v">8&#160;</span>you shall not consent to him nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him; 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>but you shall surely kill him. Your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more wickedness like this among you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>If you hear about one of your cities, which Yahweh your Elohim gives you to dwell there, that 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>certain wicked fellows have gone out from among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, “Let’s go and serve other elohims,” which you have not known, 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>then you shall inquire, investigate, and ask diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination was done among you, 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, with all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the sword. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>You shall gather all its plunder into the middle of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, with all of its plunder, to Yahweh your Elohim. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand, that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy, and have compassion on you and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers, 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>when you listen to Yahweh your Elohim’s voice, to keep all his commandments which I command you today, to do that which is right in Yahweh your Elohim’s eyes. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="14">14</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>You are the children of Yahweh your Elohim. You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>For you are a set-apart people to Yahweh your Elohim, and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>You shall not eat any abominable thing. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the chamois. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof split: the camel, the hare, and the rabbit. Because they chew the cud but don’t part the hoof, they are unclean to you. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn’t chew the cud, is unclean to you. You shall not eat their meat. You shall not touch their carcasses. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>These you may eat of all that are in the waters: you may eat whatever has fins and scales. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You shall not eat whatever doesn’t have fins and scales. It is unclean to you. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Of all clean birds you may eat. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey, 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>the red kite, the falcon, the kite of any kind, 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>every raven of any kind, 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the hawk of any kind, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>the little owl, the great owl, the horned owl, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>the pelican, the vulture, the cormorant, 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>All winged creeping things are unclean to you. They shall not be eaten. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Of all clean birds you may eat. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself. You may give it to the foreigner living among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a set-apart people to Yahweh your Elohim. 
</p><p>You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes out of the field year by year. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>You shall eat before Yahweh your Elohim, in the place which he chooses to cause his name to dwell, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to fear Yahweh your Elohim always. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it because the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose to set his name there is too far from you, when Yahweh your Elohim blesses you, 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>then you shall turn it into money, bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>You shall trade the money for whatever your soul desires: for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you. You shall eat there before Yahweh your Elohim, and you shall rejoice, you and your household. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>At the end of every three years you shall bring all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall store it within your gates. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>The Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, as well as the foreigner living among you, the fatherless, and the widow who are within your gates shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your Elohim may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="15">15</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>At the end of every seven years, you shall cancel debts. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>This is the way it shall be done: every owner of a loan shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not require payment from his neighbor and his brother, because Yahweh’s release has been proclaimed. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Of a foreigner you may require it; but whatever of yours is with your brother, your hand shall release. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>However there will be no poor with you (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you for an inheritance to possess) 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>if only you diligently listen to Yahweh your Elohim’s voice, to observe to do all this commandment which I command you today. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For Yahweh your Elohim will bless you, as he promised you. You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow. You will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother; 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, which he lacks. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Beware that there not be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, “The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,” and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing; and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You shall surely give, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because it is for this thing Yahweh your Elohim will bless you in all your work and in all that you put your hand to. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>For the poor will never cease out of the land. Therefore I command you to surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your wine press. As Yahweh your Elohim has blessed you, you shall give to him. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your Elohim redeemed you. Therefore I command you this thing today. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>It shall be, if he tells you, “I will not go out from you,” because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for he has been double the value of a hired hand as he served you six years. Yahweh your Elohim will bless you in all that you do. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>You shall dedicate all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock to Yahweh your Elohim. You shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>You shall eat it before Yahweh your Elohim year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>If it has any defect—is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your Elohim. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>You shall eat it within your gates. The unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle and as the deer. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Only you shall not eat its blood. You shall pour it out on the ground like water.

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your Elohim; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your Elohim brought you out of Egypt by night. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your Elohim, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose to cause his name to dwell there. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste) that you may remember the day when you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>No yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the meat, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates which Yahweh your Elohim gives you; 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>but at the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose to cause his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came out of Egypt. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your Elohim chooses. In the morning you shall return to your tents. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your Elohim. You shall do no work. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You shall count for yourselves seven weeks. From the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to count seven weeks. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your Elohim with a tribute of a free will offering of your hand, which you shall give according to how Yahweh your Elohim blesses you. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>You shall rejoice before Yahweh your Elohim: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow who are among you, in the place which Yahweh your Elohim shall choose to cause his name to dwell there. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt. You shall observe and do these statutes. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>You shall keep the feast of booths seven days, after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your wine press. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>You shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow who are within your gates. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>You shall keep a feast to Yahweh your Elohim seven days in the place which Yahweh chooses, because Yahweh your Elohim will bless you in all your increase and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Three times in a year all of your males shall appear before Yahweh your Elohim in the place which he chooses: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths. They shall not appear before Yahweh empty. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Every man shall give as he is able, according to Yahweh your Elohim’s blessing which he has given you. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which Yahweh your Elohim gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality. You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live and inherit the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside Yahweh your Elohim’s altar, which you shall make for yourselves. 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Neither shall you set yourself up a sacred stone which Yahweh your Elohim hates. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="17">17</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your Elohim an ox or a sheep in which is a defect or anything evil; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your Elohim. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>If there is found among you, within any of your gates which Yahweh your Elohim gives you, a man or woman who does that which is evil in Yahweh your Elohim’s sight in transgressing his covenant, 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>and has gone and served other elohims and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not commanded, 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>and you are told, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel, 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from among you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your Elohim chooses. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>You shall come to the priests who are Levites and to the judge who shall be in those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give you the verdict. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>You shall do according to the decisions of the verdict which they shall give you from that place which Yahweh chooses. You shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>According to the decisions of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not turn away from the sentence which they announce to you, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>The man who does presumptuously in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your Elohim, or to the judge, even that man shall die. You shall put away the evil from Israel. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>All the people shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>When you have come to the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you, and possess it and dwell in it, and say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,” 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>you shall surely set him whom Yahweh your Elohim chooses as king over yourselves. You shall set as king over you one from among your brothers. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; because Yahweh has said to you, “You shall not go back that way again.” 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>He shall not multiply women to himself, that his heart not turn away. He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the Levitical priests. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Yahweh his Elohim, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them; 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn away from the commandment to the right hand, or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the middle of Israel. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="18">18</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>The priests and the Levites—all the tribe of Levi—shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire and his portion. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>They shall have no inheritance among their brothers. Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest: the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the inner parts. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>For Yahweh your Elohim has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to minister in Yahweh’s name, him and his sons forever. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel where he lives, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose, 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his Elohim, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>They shall have like portions to eat, in addition to that which comes from the sale of his family possessions. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>When you have come into the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the abominations of those nations. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who tells fortunes, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>or a charmer, or someone who consults with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh. Because of these abominations, Yahweh your Elohim drives them out from before you. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>You shall be blameless with Yahweh your Elohim. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>For these nations that you shall dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your Elohim has not allowed you so to do. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>This is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your Elohim in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not hear again Yahweh my Elohim’s voice, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken. 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other elohims, that same prophet shall die.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>You may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?” 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>When a prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>When Yahweh your Elohim cuts off the nations whose land Yahweh your Elohim gives you, and you succeed them and dwell in their cities and in their houses, 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the middle of your land, which Yahweh your Elohim gives you to possess. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land which Yahweh your Elohim causes you to inherit into three parts, that every man slayer may flee there. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him in time past—<span class="v">5&#160;</span>as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood and his hand swings the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and hits his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and live. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer while hot anger is in his heart and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally, even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>If Yahweh your Elohim enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers; 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>and if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you today, to love Yahweh your Elohim, and to walk ever in his ways, then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, in addition to these three. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you for an inheritance, leaving blood guilt on you. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>But if any man hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities; 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with you. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Yahweh your Elohim gives you to possess. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days; 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother, 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from among you. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil among you. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more numerous than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your Elohim, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, is with you. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people, 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>and shall tell them, “Hear, Israel, you draw near today to battle against your enemies. Don’t let your heart faint! Don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them; 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>for Yahweh your Elohim is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The officers shall speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>What man is there who has pledged to be married to a woman, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.” 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, “What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother’s heart melt as his heart.” 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>It shall be, if it gives you answer of peace and opens to you, then it shall be that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>When Yahweh your Elohim delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword; 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may use the plunder of your enemies, which Yahweh your Elohim has given you. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>But of the cities of these peoples that Yahweh your Elohim gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Yahweh your Elohim has commanded you; 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>that they not teach you to follow all their abominations, which they have done for their elohims; so would you sin against Yahweh your Elohim. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged by you? 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>If someone is found slain in the land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you to possess, lying in the field, and it isn’t known who has struck him, 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn’t been worked with and which has not drawn in the yoke. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The priests the sons of Levi shall come near, for them Yahweh your Elohim has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in Yahweh’s name; and according to their word shall every controversy and every assault be decided. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>All the elders of that city which is nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>They shall answer and say, “Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don’t allow innocent blood among your people Israel.” The blood shall be forgiven them.

</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your Elohim delivers them into your hands and you carry them away captive, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her, and desire to take her as your woman, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>then you shall bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head and trim her nails. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>She shall take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her owner, and she shall be your woman. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.

<span class="v">15&#160;</span>If a man has two women, the one beloved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated, 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them, 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from among you. All Israel shall hear, and fear.

<span class="v">22&#160;</span>If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree, 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of Elohim. Don’t defile your land which Yahweh your Elohim gives you for an inheritance.

<span class="v">3&#160;</span>So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost and you have found. You may not hide yourself.

<span class="v">15&#160;</span>then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.

<span class="v">18&#160;</span>The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>They shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver,<span class="f">+ \fr 22:19 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 100 shekels is about a kilogram or 2.2 pounds.</span> and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has given a bad name to a virgin of Israel. She shall be his woman. He may not put her away all his days.

<span class="v">20&#160;</span>But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady,

<span class="v">24&#160;</span>then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn’t cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor’s woman. So you shall remove the evil from among you. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die; 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter; 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her and lies with her, and they are found, 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels<span class="f">+ \fr 22:29 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.</span> of silver. She shall be his woman, because he has humbled her. He may not put her away all his days.

<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Yahweh will strike you with consumption, with fever, with inflammation, with fiery heat, with the sword, with blight, and with mildew. They will pursue you until you perish. 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Your sky that is over your head will be bronze, and the earth that is under you will be iron. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust. It will come down on you from the sky, until you are destroyed. 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies. You will go out one way against them, and will flee seven ways before them. You will be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth. 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>Your dead bodies will be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there will be no one to frighten them away. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Yahweh will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with the tumors, with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can not be healed. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Yahweh will strike you with madness, with blindness, and with astonishment of heart. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>You will grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways. You will only be oppressed and robbed always, and there will be no one to save you. 
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>You will betroth a woman, and another man shall lie with her. You will build a house, and you won’t dwell in it. You will plant a vineyard, and not use its fruit. 
<span class="v">31&#160;</span>Your ox will be slain before your eyes, and you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be violently taken away from before your face, and will not be restored to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have no one to save you. 
<span class="v">32&#160;</span>Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people. Your eyes will look and fail with longing for them all day long. There will be no power in your hand. 
<span class="v">33&#160;</span>A nation which you don’t know will eat the fruit of your ground and all of your work. You will only be oppressed and crushed always, 
<span class="v">34&#160;</span>so that the sights that you see with your eyes will drive you mad. 
<span class="v">35&#160;</span>Yahweh will strike you in the knees and in the legs with a sore boil, of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. 
<span class="v">36&#160;</span>Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you will set over yourselves, to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers. There you will serve other elohims of wood and stone. 
<span class="v">37&#160;</span>You will become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples where Yahweh will lead you away. 
<span class="v">38&#160;</span>You will carry much seed out into the field, and will gather little in, for the locust will consume it. 
<span class="v">39&#160;</span>You will plant vineyards and dress them, but you will neither drink of the wine, nor harvest, because worms will eat them. 
<span class="v">40&#160;</span>You will have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you won’t anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives will drop off. 
<span class="v">41&#160;</span>You will father sons and daughters, but they will not be yours, for they will go into captivity. 
<span class="v">42&#160;</span>Locusts will consume all of your trees and the fruit of your ground. 
<span class="v">43&#160;</span>The foreigner who is among you will mount up above you higher and higher, and you will come down lower and lower. 
<span class="v">44&#160;</span>He will lend to you, and you won’t lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">45&#160;</span>All these curses will come on you, and will pursue you and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your Elohim’s voice, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you. 
<span class="v">46&#160;</span>They will be for a sign and for a wonder to you and to your offspring forever. 
<span class="v">47&#160;</span>Because you didn’t serve Yahweh your Elohim with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; 
<span class="v">48&#160;</span>therefore you will serve your enemies whom Yahweh sends against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in lack of all things. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. 
<span class="v">49&#160;</span>Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies: a nation whose language you will not understand, 
<span class="v">50&#160;</span>a nation of fierce facial expressions, that doesn’t respect the elderly, nor show favor to the young. 
<span class="v">51&#160;</span>They will eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed. They also won’t leave you grain, new wine, oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish. 
<span class="v">52&#160;</span>They will besiege you in all your gates until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout all your land. They will besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land which Yahweh your Elohim has given you. 
<span class="v">53&#160;</span>You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your Elohim has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies will distress you. 
<span class="v">54&#160;</span>The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil toward his brother, toward the woman whom he loves, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining, 
<span class="v">55&#160;</span>so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he will eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in all your gates. 
<span class="v">56&#160;</span>The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil toward the man that she loves, toward her son, toward her daughter, 
<span class="v">57&#160;</span>toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates. 
<span class="v">58&#160;</span>If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH your Elohim, 
<span class="v">59&#160;</span>then Yahweh will make your plagues and the plagues of your offspring fearful, even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long duration. 
<span class="v">60&#160;</span>He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you. 
<span class="v">61&#160;</span>Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, Yahweh will bring them on you until you are destroyed. 
<span class="v">62&#160;</span>You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for multitude, because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your Elohim’s voice. 
<span class="v">63&#160;</span>It will happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish and to destroy you. You will be plucked from the land that you are going in to possess. 
<span class="v">64&#160;</span>Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. There you will serve other elohims which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone. 
<span class="v">65&#160;</span>Among these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and pining of soul. 
<span class="v">66&#160;</span>Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life. 
<span class="v">67&#160;</span>In the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening you will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see. 
<span class="v">68&#160;</span>Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I told to you that you would never see it again. There you will offer yourselves to your enemies for male and female slaves, and nobody will buy you. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="29">29</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Moses called to all Israel, and said to them: 
</p><p>Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land; 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>But Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown old on you, and your sandals have not grown old on your feet. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am Yahweh your Elohim. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>We took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>All of you stand today in the presence of Yahweh your Elohim: your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>your little ones, your women, and the foreigners who are in the middle of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water, 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your Elohim, and into his oath, which Yahweh your Elohim makes with you today, 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your Elohim, as he spoke to you and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only, 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>but with those who stand here with us today before Yahweh our Elohim, and also with those who are not here with us today 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the middle of the nations through which you passed; 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>and you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them); 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>lest there should be among you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away today from Yahweh our Elohim, to go to serve the elohims of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison; 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” to destroy the moist with the dry. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Yahweh will not pardon him, but then Yahweh’s anger and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will fall on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Yahweh will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>The generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick, 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath. 
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>Even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the Elohim of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>and went and served other elohims and worshiped them, elohims that they didn’t know and that he had not given to them. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book. 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>The secret things belong to Yahweh our Elohim; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="30">30</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations where Yahweh your Elohim has driven you, 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>and return to Yahweh your Elohim and obey his voice according to all that I command you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul, 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>that then Yahweh your Elohim will release you from captivity, have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples where Yahweh your Elohim has scattered you. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there Yahweh your Elohim will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you will possess it. He will do you good, and increase your numbers more than your fathers. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your offspring, to love Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>You shall return and obey Yahweh’s voice, and do all his commandments which I command you today. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim will make you prosperous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good; for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>if you will obey Yahweh your Elohim’s voice, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, if you turn to Yahweh your Elohim with all your heart and with all your soul. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>For this commandment which I command you today is not too hard for you or too distant. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>For I command you today to love Yahweh your Elohim, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your Elohim may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away and worship other elohims, and serve them, 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants, 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>to love Yahweh your Elohim, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days, that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="31">31</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>He said to them, “I am one hundred twenty years old today. I can no more go out and come in. Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’ 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Yahweh your Elohim himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them, for Yahweh your Elohim himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Yahweh himself is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be discouraged.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your Elohim in the place which he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, learn, fear Yahweh your Elohim, and observe to do all the words of this law, 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>and that their children, who have not known, may hear and learn to fear Yahweh your Elohim, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.” 
</p><p>Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up and play the prostitute after the strange elohims of the land where they go to be among them, and will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our Elohim is not among us?’ 
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other elohims. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>“Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then they will turn to other elohims, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I promised them.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, saying, 
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh your Elohim’s covenant, that it may be there for a witness against you. 
<span class="v">27&#160;</span>For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. How much more after my death? 
<span class="v">28&#160;</span>Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
<span class="v">29&#160;</span>For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn away from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days, because you will do that which is evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">30&#160;</span>Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="32">32</h2>
