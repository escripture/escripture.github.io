<div class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Now Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. 
</div><div class="q2">Before you were born, I sanctified you. 
</div><div class="q2">I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then I said, “Ah, Lord I don’t know how to speak; for I am a child.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for you must go to whomever I send you, and you must say whatever I command you. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and touched my mouth. Then Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” 
</div><div class="p">I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?” 
</div><div class="p">I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">“They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, 
</div><div class="q2">and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, 
</div><div class="q2">in that they have forsaken me, 
</div><div class="q2">and have burned incense to other elohims, 
</div><div class="q2">and worshiped the works of their own hands. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you”, says Yahweh, “to rescue you.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says, 
</div><div class="q1">“I remember for you the kindness of your youth, 
</div><div class="q2">your love as a bride, 
</div><div class="q1">how you went after me in the wilderness, 
</div><div class="q2">in a land that was not sown. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Israel was set-apartness to Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">the first fruits of his increase. 
</div><div class="q1">All who devour him will be held guilty. 
</div><div class="q2">Evil will come on them,”&#160;’ says Yahweh.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel! 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahweh says, 
</div><div class="q1">“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, 
</div><div class="q2">that they have gone far from me, 
</div><div class="q1">and have walked after worthless vanity, 
</div><div class="q2">and have become worthless? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, 
</div><div class="q2">who led us through the wilderness, 
</div><div class="q2">through a land of deserts and of pits, 
</div><div class="q2">through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, 
</div><div class="q2">through a land that no one passed through, 
</div><div class="q2">and where no man lived?’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I brought you into a plentiful land 
</div><div class="q2">to eat its fruit and its goodness; 
</div><div class="q1">but when you entered, you defiled my land, 
</div><div class="q2">and made my heritage an abomination. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’ 
</div><div class="q2">and those who handle the law didn’t know me. 
</div><div class="q1">The rulers also transgressed against me, 
</div><div class="q2">and the prophets prophesied by Baal 
</div><div class="q2">and followed things that do not profit. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh, 
</div><div class="q2">“and I will contend with your children’s children. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see. 
</div><div class="q2">Send to Kedar, and consider diligently, 
</div><div class="q2">and see if there has been such a thing. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Has a nation changed its elohims, 
</div><div class="q2">which really are no elohims? 
</div><div class="q2">But my people have changed their glory for that which doesn’t profit. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Be astonished, you heavens, at this 
</div><div class="q2">and be horribly afraid. 
</div><div class="q2">Be very desolate,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“For my people have committed two evils: 
</div><div class="q2">they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, 
</div><div class="q2">and cut out cisterns for themselves: broken cisterns that can’t hold water. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Is Israel a slave? 
</div><div class="q2">Is he born into slavery? 
</div><div class="q2">Why has he become a captive? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The young lions have roared at him and raised their voices. 
</div><div class="q2">They have made his land waste. 
</div><div class="q2">His cities are burned up, without inhabitant. 
</div><div class="q2">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“Haven’t you brought this on yourself, 
</div><div class="q2">in that you have forsaken Yahweh your Elohim, when he led you by the way? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? 
</div><div class="q2">Or why do you go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“Your own wickedness will correct you, 
</div><div class="q2">and your backsliding will rebuke you. 
</div><div class="q1">Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing, 
</div><div class="q2">that you have forsaken Yahweh your Elohim, 
</div><div class="q2">and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“For long ago I broke off your yoke, 
</div><div class="q2">and burst your bonds. 
</div><div class="q1">You said, ‘I will not serve;’ 
</div><div class="q2">for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself, 
</div><div class="q2">playing the prostitute. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, 
</div><div class="q2">a pure and faithful seed. 
</div><div class="q2">How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>For though you wash yourself with lye, 
</div><div class="q2">and use much soap, 
</div><div class="q2">yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled. 
</div><div class="q2">I have not gone after the Baals’? 
</div><div class="q1">See your way in the valley. 
</div><div class="q2">Know what you have done. 
</div><div class="q1">You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways, 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving. 
</div><div class="q2">When she is in heat, who can turn her away? 
</div><div class="q2">All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>“Keep your feet from being bare, 
</div><div class="q2">and your throat from thirst. 
</div><div class="q1">But you said, ‘It is in vain. 
</div><div class="q2">No, for I have loved strangers, 
</div><div class="q2">and I will go after them.’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, 
</div><div class="q2">so the house of Israel is ashamed—</div><div class="q2">they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>who tell wood, ‘You are my father,’ 
</div><div class="q2">and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me,’ 
</div><div class="q1">for they have turned their back to me, 
</div><div class="q2">and not their face, 
</div><div class="q2">but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us!’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“But where are your elohims that you have made for yourselves? 
</div><div class="q2">Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble, 
</div><div class="q2">for you have as many elohims as you have towns, O Judah. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>“Why will you contend with me? 
</div><div class="q2">You all have transgressed against me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>“I have struck your children in vain. 
</div><div class="q2">They received no correction. 
</div><div class="q1">Your own sword has devoured your prophets, 
</div><div class="q2">like a destroying lion. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Generation, consider Yahweh’s word. 
</div><div class="q2">Have I been a wilderness to Israel? 
</div><div class="q2">Or a land of thick darkness? 
</div><div class="q1">Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose. 
</div><div class="q2">We will come to you no more’? 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>“Can a virgin forget her ornaments, 
</div><div class="q2">or a bride her attire? 
</div><div class="q2">Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>How well you prepare your way to seek love! 
</div><div class="q2">Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts. 
</div><div class="q2">You didn’t find them breaking in, 
</div><div class="q2">but it is because of all these things. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>35&#160;</sup>“Yet you said, ‘I am innocent. 
</div><div class="q2">Surely his anger has turned away from me.’ 
</div><div class="q1">“Behold, I will judge you, 
</div><div class="q2">because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’ 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Why do you go about so much to change your ways? 
</div><div class="q2">You will be ashamed of Egypt also, 
</div><div class="q2">as you were ashamed of Assyria. 
</div><div class="q1">
<sup>37&#160;</sup>You will also leave that place with your hands on your head; 
</div><div class="q2">for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, 
</div><div class="q2">and you won’t prosper with them. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“They say, ‘If a man puts away his woman, and she goes from him, and becomes another man’s, should he return to her again?’ Wouldn’t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat waiting for them by the road, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no latter rain; yet you have had a prostitute’s forehead and you refused to be ashamed. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Will you not from this time cry to me, ‘My Father, you are the guide of my youth!’? 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Moreover, Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, “Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has played the prostitute there. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I said after she had done all these things, ‘She will return to me;’ but she didn’t return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I saw when, for this very cause, that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, had no fear, but she also went and played the prostitute. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Because she took her prostitution lightly, the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with wood. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, you backsliding Israel,’ says Yahweh; ‘I will not look in anger on you, for I am merciful,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will not keep anger forever. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your Elohim, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,’&#160;” says Yahweh. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“Return, backsliding children,” says Yahweh, “for I am an owner to you. I will take one of you from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days,” says Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘the ark of Yahweh’s covenant!’ It will not come to mind. They won’t remember it. They won’t miss it, nor will another be made. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh’s Throne;’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Yahweh’s name, to Jerusalem. They will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“But I said, ‘How I desire to put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said, ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’ 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“Surely as a woman treacherously departs from her friend, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says Yahweh. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their Elohim. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding. 
</div><div class="p">“Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our Elohim. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Truly help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains, is in vain. Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our Elohim. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our Elohim, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed Yahweh our Elohim’s voice.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“If you will return, Israel,” says Yahweh, “if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you will not be removed; 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and you will swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. The nations will bless themselves in him, and they will glory in him.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up your fallow ground, and don’t sow among thorns. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let’s go into the fortified cities!’ 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Don’t wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way. He has gone out from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn’t turned back from us. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“It will happen at that day,” says Yahweh, “that the heart of the king will perish, along with the heart of the princes. The priests will be astonished, and the prophets will wonder.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind blows from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>A full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you? 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim: 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“Tell the nations, behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,’&#160;” says Yahweh. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness, for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet? 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>“For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but they don’t know how to do good.” 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>I saw the earth and, behold, it was waste and void, and the heavens, and they had no light. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>(after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem), 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). It said: 
</div><div class="pi1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Take women and father sons and daughters. Take women for your sons, and give your daughters to men, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and don’t be diminished. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you will have peace.” 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>For Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel says: “Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you. Don’t listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says Yahweh. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says, “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,” says Yahweh, “thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>You shall seek me and find me, when you search for me with all your heart. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will be found by you,” says Yahweh, “and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh. I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.” 
</div><div class="pi1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Because you have said, “Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon,”

<sup>17&#160;</sup>Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that can’t be eaten, they are so bad. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>because they have not listened to my words,” says Yahweh, “with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear,” says Yahweh.

<sup>20&#160;</sup>Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you captives whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.

<sup>22&#160;</sup>A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’ 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>because they have done foolish things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ women, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them. I am he who knows, and am witness,” says Yahweh. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,

<sup>27&#160;</sup>Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you, 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?”&#160;’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.

<sup>32&#160;</sup>therefore Yahweh says, “Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He won’t see the good that I will do to my people,” says Yahweh, “because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.”&#160;’&#160;”

<sup>17&#160;</sup>“Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for you.

<sup>21&#160;</sup>and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>They came in and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do. Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.

<sup>29&#160;</sup>The Chaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other elohims, to provoke me to anger. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>“For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before my face, 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech, which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Now therefore Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says concerning this city, about which you say, “It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:”

<sup>38&#160;</sup>Then they will be my people, and I will be their Elohim. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good and the good of their children after them. 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me. 
<sup>41&#160;</sup>Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>42&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says: “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.

<sup>7&#160;</sup>I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel, and will build them as at the first. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’

<sup>25&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth, 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.”

<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, with all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying: 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Babylon.”&#160;’ 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Yet hear Yahweh’s word, O Zedekiah king of Judah. Yahweh says concerning you, ‘You won’t die by the sword.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free, that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant and everyone his female servant go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and let them go, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying: 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you. But your fathers didn’t listen to me, and didn’t incline their ear. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name; 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh says: “You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor.

<sup>18&#160;</sup>I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts: 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;

<sup>5&#160;</sup>I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you nor your children, forever.

<sup>8&#160;</sup>We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our women, our sons, or our daughters; 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed; 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, ‘Come! Let’s go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’&#160;”

<sup>15&#160;</sup>I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and don’t go after other elohims to serve them.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.

<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh’s words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each return from his evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words,

<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.” 
</div><div class="p">So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.” 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They went in to the king into the court, but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn’t tear their garments. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

<sup>29&#160;</sup>Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written therein, saying, “The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal”?’&#160;” 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah took another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.

</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

<sup>13&#160;</sup>When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”

<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” 
</div><div class="p">But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days, 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>then Zedekiah the king sent and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?” 
</div><div class="p">Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land’? 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="38">38</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh says, ‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live. He will escape with his life and he will live.’ 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death, because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them; for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate), 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.” 
</div><div class="p">Jeremiah did so. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>So they lifted Jeremiah up with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house. Then the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul will live. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me: 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say, 
</div><div class="q1">“Your familiar friends have turned on you, 
</div><div class="q2">and have prevailed over you. 
</div><div class="q1">Your feet are sunk in the mire, 
</div><div class="q2">they have turned away from you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>They will bring out all your women and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’ 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’&#160;” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for the matter was not perceived. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="39">39</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate: Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim the Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer the Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the people’s houses with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the rest of the people who remained. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Take him and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should bring him home. So he lived among the people. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For I will surely save you. You won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life, because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’&#160;” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="40">40</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were carried away captive to Babylon. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your Elohim pronounced this evil on this place; 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, go there.” 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.” 
</div><div class="p">So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon, 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” 
</div><div class="p">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="41">41</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean men of war who were found there. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went, and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.” 
</div><div class="p">So he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land. 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="42">42</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your Elohim, even for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>that Yahweh your Elohim may show us the way in which we should walk, and the things that we should do.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to Yahweh your Elohim according to your words; and it will happen that whatever thing Yahweh answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your Elohim sends you to tell us. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our Elohim, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our Elohim.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>After ten days, Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>and said to them, “Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him, says: 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>‘If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Don’t be afraid of him,’ says Yahweh, ‘for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘But if you say, “We will not dwell in this land,” so that you don’t obey Yahweh your Elohim’s voice, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>saying, “No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there we will dwell;”&#160;’ 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>now therefore hear Yahweh’s word, O remnant of Judah! Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to live there, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will follow close behind you there in Egypt; and you will die there. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’ 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and my wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you, when you enter into Egypt; and you will be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.’ 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, ‘Don’t go into Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have testified to you today. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your Elohim, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our Elohim; and according to all that Yahweh our Elohim says, so declare to us, and we will do it.’ 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed Yahweh your Elohim’s voice in anything for which he has sent me to you. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="43">43</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their Elohim, with which Yahweh their Elohim had sent him to them, even all these words, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely. Yahweh our Elohim has not sent you to say, ‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’ 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.” 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah—<sup>6&#160;</sup>the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They came into the land of Egypt, for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice; and they came to Tahpanhes. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Take great stones in your hand and hide them in mortar in the brick work which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion over them. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will kindle a fire in the houses of the elohims of Egypt. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh that is in the land of Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the elohims of Egypt with fire.’&#160;” 
</div><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="44">44</h2>
<div class="p">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah. Behold, today they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other elohims that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.” 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other elohims. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.’ 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“Therefore now Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Why do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave yourselves no one remaining, 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other elohims in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live, that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their women, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your women which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

<sup>22&#160;</sup>Thus Yahweh could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you have committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation, an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is today.”

<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh’s house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house in pieces, and carried all of their bronze to Babylon. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, as gold, and that which was of silver, as silver. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house. The bronze of all these vessels was without weight. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. The second pillar also had the same, with pomegranates. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold, 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. 
</div><div class="p">So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: 
</div><div class="m">in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews; 
</div><div class="m">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons; 
</div><div class="m">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five people. 
</div><div class="m">All the people numbered four thousand six hundred. 
</div><div class="p">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and released him from prison. 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>He spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon, 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>For his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life. </div></div><script src="../main.js"></script></body></html>
