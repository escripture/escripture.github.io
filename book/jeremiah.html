<p class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Now Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. 
</p><p class="q2">Before you were born, I sanctified you. 
</p><p class="q2">I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.” 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Behold, I don’t know how to speak; for I am a child.” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for you must go to whomever I send you, and you must say whatever I command you. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and touched my mouth. Then Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” 
</p><p>I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.” 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.” 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?” 
</p><p>I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.” 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">“They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, 
</p><p class="q2">and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, 
</p><p class="q2">in that they have forsaken me, 
</p><p class="q2">and have burned incense to other elohims, 
</p><p class="q2">and worshiped the works of their own hands. 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you”, says Yahweh, “to rescue you.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says, 
</p><p class="q1">“I remember for you the kindness of your youth, 
</p><p class="q2">your love as a bride, 
</p><p class="q1">how you went after me in the wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">in a land that was not sown. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Israel was set-apartness to Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">the first fruits of his increase. 
</p><p class="q1">All who devour him will be held guilty. 
</p><p class="q2">Evil will come on them,”&#160;’ says Yahweh.” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel! 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahweh says, 
</p><p class="q1">“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, 
</p><p class="q2">that they have gone far from me, 
</p><p class="q1">and have walked after worthless vanity, 
</p><p class="q2">and have become worthless? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, 
</p><p class="q2">who led us through the wilderness, 
</p><p class="q2">through a land of deserts and of pits, 
</p><p class="q2">through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, 
</p><p class="q2">through a land that no one passed through, 
</p><p class="q2">and where no man lived?’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I brought you into a plentiful land 
</p><p class="q2">to eat its fruit and its goodness; 
</p><p class="q1">but when you entered, you defiled my land, 
</p><p class="q2">and made my heritage an abomination. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’ 
</p><p class="q2">and those who handle the law didn’t know me. 
</p><p class="q1">The rulers also transgressed against me, 
</p><p class="q2">and the prophets prophesied by Baal 
</p><p class="q2">and followed things that do not profit. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh, 
</p><p class="q2">“and I will contend with your children’s children. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>10&#160;</sup>For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see. 
</p><p class="q2">Send to Kedar, and consider diligently, 
</p><p class="q2">and see if there has been such a thing. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Has a nation changed its elohims, 
</p><p class="q2">which really are no elohims? 
</p><p class="q2">But my people have changed their glory for that which doesn’t profit. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Be astonished, you heavens, at this 
</p><p class="q2">and be horribly afraid. 
</p><p class="q2">Be very desolate,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“For my people have committed two evils: 
</p><p class="q2">they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, 
</p><p class="q2">and cut out cisterns for themselves: broken cisterns that can’t hold water. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Is Israel a slave? 
</p><p class="q2">Is he born into slavery? 
</p><p class="q2">Why has he become a captive? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The young lions have roared at him and raised their voices. 
</p><p class="q2">They have made his land waste. 
</p><p class="q2">His cities are burned up, without inhabitant. 
</p><p class="q2">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“Haven’t you brought this on yourself, 
</p><p class="q2">in that you have forsaken Yahweh your Elohim, when he led you by the way? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? 
</p><p class="q2">Or why do you go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“Your own wickedness will correct you, 
</p><p class="q2">and your backsliding will rebuke you. 
</p><p class="q1">Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing, 
</p><p class="q2">that you have forsaken Yahweh your Elohim, 
</p><p class="q2">and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“For long ago I broke off your yoke, 
</p><p class="q2">and burst your bonds. 
</p><p class="q1">You said, ‘I will not serve;’ 
</p><p class="q2">for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself, 
</p><p class="q2">playing the prostitute. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, 
</p><p class="q2">a pure and faithful seed. 
</p><p class="q2">How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>22&#160;</sup>For though you wash yourself with lye, 
</p><p class="q2">and use much soap, 
</p><p class="q2">yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>23&#160;</sup>“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled. 
</p><p class="q2">I have not gone after the Baals’? 
</p><p class="q1">See your way in the valley. 
</p><p class="q2">Know what you have done. 
</p><p class="q1">You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways, 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving. 
</p><p class="q2">When she is in heat, who can turn her away? 
</p><p class="q2">All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>25&#160;</sup>“Keep your feet from being bare, 
</p><p class="q2">and your throat from thirst. 
</p><p class="q1">But you said, ‘It is in vain. 
</p><p class="q2">No, for I have loved strangers, 
</p><p class="q2">and I will go after them.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>26&#160;</sup>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, 
</p><p class="q2">so the house of Israel is ashamed—</p><p class="q2">they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>27&#160;</sup>who tell wood, ‘You are my father,’ 
</p><p class="q2">and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me,’ 
</p><p class="q1">for they have turned their back to me, 
</p><p class="q2">and not their face, 
</p><p class="q2">but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us!’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“But where are your elohims that you have made for yourselves? 
</p><p class="q2">Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble, 
</p><p class="q2">for you have as many elohims as you have towns, O Judah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>“Why will you contend with me? 
</p><p class="q2">You all have transgressed against me,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>“I have struck your children in vain. 
</p><p class="q2">They received no correction. 
</p><p class="q1">Your own sword has devoured your prophets, 
</p><p class="q2">like a destroying lion. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Generation, consider Yahweh’s word. 
</p><p class="q2">Have I been a wilderness to Israel? 
</p><p class="q2">Or a land of thick darkness? 
</p><p class="q1">Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose. 
</p><p class="q2">We will come to you no more’? 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>32&#160;</sup>“Can a virgin forget her ornaments, 
</p><p class="q2">or a bride her attire? 
</p><p class="q2">Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>How well you prepare your way to seek love! 
</p><p class="q2">Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts. 
</p><p class="q2">You didn’t find them breaking in, 
</p><p class="q2">but it is because of all these things. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>35&#160;</sup>“Yet you said, ‘I am innocent. 
</p><p class="q2">Surely his anger has turned away from me.’ 
</p><p class="q1">“Behold, I will judge you, 
</p><p class="q2">because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Why do you go about so much to change your ways? 
</p><p class="q2">You will be ashamed of Egypt also, 
</p><p class="q2">as you were ashamed of Assyria. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>37&#160;</sup>You will also leave that place with your hands on your head; 
</p><p class="q2">for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, 
</p><p class="q2">and you won’t prosper with them. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“They say, ‘If a man puts away his woman, and she goes from him, and becomes another man’s, should he return to her again?’ Wouldn’t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p>
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat waiting for them by the road, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no latter rain; yet you have had a prostitute’s forehead and you refused to be ashamed. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Will you not from this time cry to me, ‘My Father, you are the guide of my youth!’? 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.” 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Moreover, Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, “Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has played the prostitute there. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I said after she had done all these things, ‘She will return to me;’ but she didn’t return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I saw when, for this very cause, that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, had no fear, but she also went and played the prostitute. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Because she took her prostitution lightly, the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with wood. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, you backsliding Israel,’ says Yahweh; ‘I will not look in anger on you, for I am merciful,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will not keep anger forever. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your Elohim, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,’&#160;” says Yahweh. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“Return, backsliding children,” says Yahweh, “for I am an owner to you. I will take one of you from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days,” says Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘the ark of Yahweh’s covenant!’ It will not come to mind. They won’t remember it. They won’t miss it, nor will another be made. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh’s Throne;’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Yahweh’s name, to Jerusalem. They will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers. 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“But I said, ‘How I desire to put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said, ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“Surely as a woman treacherously departs from her friend, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says Yahweh. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their Elohim. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding. 
</p><p>“Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our Elohim. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Truly help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains, is in vain. Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our Elohim. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our Elohim, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed Yahweh our Elohim’s voice.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“If you will return, Israel,” says Yahweh, “if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you will not be removed; 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and you will swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. The nations will bless themselves in him, and they will glory in him.” 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up your fallow ground, and don’t sow among thorns. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let’s go into the fortified cities!’ 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Don’t wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way. He has gone out from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn’t turned back from us. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“It will happen at that day,” says Yahweh, “that the heart of the king will perish, along with the heart of the princes. The priests will be astonished, and the prophets will wonder.” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind blows from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>A full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.” 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you? 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim: 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“Tell the nations, behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,’&#160;” says Yahweh. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness, for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.” 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet? 
</p><p>
<sup>22&#160;</sup>“For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but they don’t know how to do good.” 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>I saw the earth and, behold, it was waste and void, and the heavens, and they had no light. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, before his fierce anger. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says, “The whole land will be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black, because I have spoken it. I have planned it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.” 
</p><p>
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers. They go into the thickets and climb up on the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with makeup, you make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers despise you. They seek your life. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.”

<sup>1&#160;</sup>“Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its wide places, if you can find a man, if there is anyone who does justly, who seeks truth, then I will pardon her.

<sup>3&#160;</sup>O Yahweh, don’t your eyes look on truth? You have stricken them, but they were not grieved. You have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused to return.

<sup>5&#160;</sup>I will go to the great men and will speak to them, for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their Elohim.” But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore a lion out of the forest will kill them. A wolf of the evenings will destroy them. A leopard will watch against their cities. Everyone who goes out there will be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many and their backsliding has increased.

<sup>7&#160;</sup>“How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and sworn by what are no elohims. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes’ houses.

<sup>10&#160;</sup>“Go up on her walls, and destroy, but don’t make a full end. Take away her branches, for they are not Yahweh’s.

<sup>15&#160;</sup>Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far away, house of Israel,” says Yahweh. “It is a mighty nation. It is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don’t know and don’t understand what they say. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Their quiver is an open tomb. They are all mighty men. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>They will eat up your harvest and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat. They will eat up your flocks and your herds. They will eat up your vines and your fig trees. They will beat down your fortified cities in which you trust with the sword. 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“But even in those days,” says Yahweh, “I will not make a full end of you. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>It will happen when you say, ‘Why has Yahweh our Elohim done all these things to us?’ Then you shall say to them, ‘Just as you have forsaken me and served foreign elohims in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>‘Hear this now, foolish people without understanding, who have eyes, and don’t see, who have ears, and don’t hear: 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Don’t you fear me?’ says Yahweh; ‘Won’t you tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it can’t pass it? Though its waves toss themselves, yet they can’t prevail. Though they roar, they still can’t pass over it.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>23&#160;</sup>“But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart. They have revolted and gone. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>They don’t say in their heart, ‘Let’s now fear Yahweh our Elohim, who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season, who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>25&#160;</sup>“Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>For wicked men are found among my people. They watch, as fowlers lie in wait. They set a trap. They catch men. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore they have become great, and grew rich. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>They have grown fat. They shine; yes, they excel in deeds of wickedness. They don’t plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and they don’t defend the rights of the needy.

<sup>12&#160;</sup>Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that he may declare it? Why has the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?

<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahweh says, “Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in my ways,

<sup>15&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says, “Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”

<sup>23&#160;</sup>Yahweh says,

<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,

<sup>6&#160;</sup>Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Thus said Yahweh, “Go, and buy a potter’s earthen container, and take some of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests; 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I will tell you. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Say, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel says, “Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which whoever hears, his ears will tingle. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Because they have forsaken me, and have defiled this place, and have burned incense in it to other elohims that they didn’t know—they, their fathers, and the kings of Judah—and have filled this place with the blood of innocents, 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>and have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I didn’t command, nor speak, which didn’t even enter into my mind. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place will no more be called ‘Topheth’, nor ‘The Valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’. 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, will distress them.”&#160;’

<sup>10&#160;</sup>“Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.

<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of Yahweh’s house, and said to all the people:

<sup>33&#160;</sup>“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from Yahweh?’ Then you shall tell them, ‘&#160;“What message? I will cast you off,” says Yahweh.’

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahweh showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before Yahweh’s temple, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” 
</p><p>I said, “Figs. The good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad that they can’t be eaten.”

<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel says: ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, as good.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (this was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, Yahweh’s word has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened. 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear), 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>saying, “Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Don’t go after other elohims to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; then I will do you no harm.” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“Yet you have not listened to me,” says Yahweh, “that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.” 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh of Armies says: “Because you have not heard my words, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,” says Yahweh, “and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around. I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“It will happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,” says Yahweh, “for their iniquity. I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate forever. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.” 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>For Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send among them.” 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then I took the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me: 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is today; 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes, and all his people; 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon; 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;

<sup>26&#160;</sup>and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth. The king of Sheshach will drink after them. 
</p><p>
<sup>27&#160;</sup>“You shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel says: “Drink, and be drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.”&#160;’ 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “You shall surely drink. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You will not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies.”&#160;’

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from Yahweh: 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh says: ‘Stand in the court of Yahweh’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah which come to worship in Yahweh’s house, all the words that I command you to speak to them. Don’t omit a word. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>It may be they will listen, and every man turn from his evil way, that I may relent from the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of their doings.’&#160;” 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>You shall tell them, “Yahweh says: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law which I have set before you, 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them—but you have not listened—<sup>6&#160;</sup>then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in Yahweh’s house. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>When Jeremiah had finished speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You shall surely die! 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Why have you prophesied in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant’?” All the people were crowded around Jeremiah in Yahweh’s house. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to Yahweh’s house; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, “This man is worthy of death, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.” 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, “Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey Yahweh your Elohim’s voice; then Yahweh will relent from the evil that he has pronounced against you. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>But as for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me what is good and right in your eyes. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for in truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.” 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: “This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our Elohim.” 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then certain of the elders of the land rose up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: 
</p><p class="q1">“&#160;‘Zion will be plowed as a field, 
</p><p class="q2">and Jerusalem will become heaps, 
</p><p class="q2">and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.’

<sup>19&#160;</sup>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster which he had pronounced against them? We would commit great evil against our own souls that way!” 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>There was also a man who prophesied in Yahweh’s name, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>When Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Then Jehoiakim the king sent Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him into Egypt. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>They fetched Uriah out of Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people. 
</p><p>
<sup>24&#160;</sup>But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they didn’t give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahweh says to me: “Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Then send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the children of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Give them a command to their masters, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel says, “You shall tell your masters: 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>‘I have made the earth, the men, and the animals that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm. I give it to whom it seems right to me. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. I have also given the animals of the field to him to serve him. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>All the nations will serve him, his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings will make him their bondservant. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“&#160;‘It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,’ says Yahweh, ‘with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>But as for you, don’t listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your dreams, to your soothsayers, or to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon;”

<sup>11&#160;</sup>But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, that nation I will let remain in their own land,’ says Yahweh; ‘and they will till it and dwell in it.’&#160;”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>For I have not sent them,” says Yahweh, “but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.” 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Yahweh says, “Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of Yahweh’s house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Don’t listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a desolation? 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>But if they are prophets, and if Yahweh’s word is with them, let them now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies, that the vessels which are left in Yahweh’s house, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don’t go to Babylon. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>For Yahweh of Armies says concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—<sup>21&#160;</sup>yes, Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says concerning the vessels that are left in Yahweh’s house, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem: 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>‘They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will be, until the day that I visit them,’ says Yahweh; ‘then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="28">28</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in Yahweh’s house, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in Yahweh’s house, 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>even the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so. May Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh’s house, and all those who are captives, from Babylon to this place. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people: 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens, then the prophet will be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Yahweh says: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’&#160;” Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “You have broken the bars of wood, but you have made in their place bars of iron.” 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>For Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel says, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. I have also given him the animals of the field.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! Yahweh has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>(after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem), 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). It said: 
</p><p class="pi1">
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Take women and father sons and daughters. Take women for your sons, and give your daughters to men, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and don’t be diminished. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you will have peace.”

<sup>9&#160;</sup>For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says Yahweh. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says, “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,” says Yahweh, “thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>You shall seek me and find me, when you search for me with all your heart.

<sup>15&#160;</sup>Because you have said, “Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon,”

<sup>19&#160;</sup>because they have not listened to my words,” says Yahweh, “with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear,” says Yahweh.

<sup>20&#160;</sup>Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you captives whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.

<sup>22&#160;</sup>A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’

</p><p>
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,

</p><p>
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>“Behold, I am Yahweh, the Elohim of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for me? 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh says: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>The Chaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other elohims, to provoke me to anger. 
</p><p>
<sup>30&#160;</sup>“For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before my face, 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech, which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.” 
</p><p>
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Now therefore Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says concerning this city, about which you say, “It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:” 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>“Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell safely. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>Then they will be my people, and I will be their Elohim. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good and the good of their children after them. 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me. 
<sup>41&#160;</sup>Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.” 
</p><p>
<sup>42&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says: “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them. 
<sup>43&#160;</sup>Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, ‘It is desolate, without man or animal. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ 
<sup>44&#160;</sup>Men will buy fields for money, sign the deeds, seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed,” says Yahweh.

<p class="nb">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still locked up in the court of the guard, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it—Yahweh is his name, says: 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you don’t know.’ 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>For Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword: 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>‘While men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city, 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>behold, I will bring it health and healing, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel, and will build them as at the first. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’ 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for his loving kindness endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Yahweh of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them,” says Yahweh. 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“In those days and at that time, 
</p><p class="q2">I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David. 
</p><p class="q2">He will execute justice and righteousness in the land. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>16&#160;</sup>In those days Judah will be saved,

</p><p class="q1">This is the name by which she will be called:

</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>For Yahweh says: “David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.” 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“Yahweh says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time, 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>then my covenant could also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levitical priests, my ministers. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>“Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has Yahweh cast off the two families which he chose?’ Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.” 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth, 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="34">34</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, with all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying: 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Babylon.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Yet hear Yahweh’s word, O Zedekiah king of Judah. Yahweh says concerning you, ‘You won’t die by the sword. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>You will die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will make a burning for you. They will lament you, saying, “Ah Lord!” for I have spoken the word,’ says Yahweh.” 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free, that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant and everyone his female servant go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and let them go, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying: 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you. But your fathers didn’t listen to me, and didn’t incline their ear. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name; 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh says: “You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim to you a liberty,” says Yahweh, “to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. I will make you be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts: 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth. 
</p><p>
<sup>21&#160;</sup>“I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their life and into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, who has gone away from you. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Behold, I will command,” says Yahweh, “and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into Yahweh’s house, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.” 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>and I brought them into Yahweh’s house, into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of Elohim, which was by the room of the princes, which was above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!” 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you nor your children, forever. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.’ 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our women, our sons, or our daughters; 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed; 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, ‘Come! Let’s go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words?” says Yahweh. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and you have not listened to me. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and don’t go after other elohims to serve them. Then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers;’ but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“Therefore Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you,’ 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>therefore Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before me forever.’&#160;”

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah even to this day. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them, that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted. I can’t go into Yahweh’s house. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh’s words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each return from his evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people.” 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people. 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room; and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.” 
</p><p>So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.” 
</p><p>So Baruch read it in their hearing. 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.” 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?” 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.” 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.” 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They went in to the king into the court, but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn’t tear their garments. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them. 
</p><p>
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written therein, saying, “The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal”?’&#160;” 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>32&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah took another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="37">37</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to Yahweh’s words, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah. 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to Yahweh our Elohim for us.” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people, for they had not put him into prison. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take it and burn it with fire.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Yahweh says, ‘Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us;” for they will not depart. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and only wounded men remained among them, they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>When the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!” 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” 
</p><p>But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison. 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days, 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>then Zedekiah the king sent and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?” 
</p><p>Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.” 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land’? 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.” 
</p><p>
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh says, ‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live. He will escape with his life and he will live.’ 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death, because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them; for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.” 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire. 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate), 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.” 
</p><p>Jeremiah did so. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>So they lifted Jeremiah up with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house. Then the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.” 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.” 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.” 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.” 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul will live. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me: 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say, 
</p><p class="q1">“Your familiar friends have turned on you, 
</p><p class="q2">and have prevailed over you. 
</p><p class="q1">Your feet are sunk in the mire, 
</p><p class="q2">they have turned away from you.” 
</p><p>
<sup>23&#160;</sup>They will bring out all your women and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’ 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for the matter was not perceived. 
</p><p>
<sup>28&#160;</sup>So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="39">39</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate: Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim the Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer the Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah. 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the people’s houses with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the rest of the people who remained. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Take him and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.” 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should bring him home. So he lived among the people. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For I will surely save you. You won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life, because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="40">40</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were carried away captive to Babylon. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your Elohim pronounced this evil on this place; 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, go there.” 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.” 
</p><p>So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land. 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon, 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits. 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” 
</p><p>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?” 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="41">41</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean men of war who were found there. 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went, and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.” 
</p><p>So he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon. 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="42">42</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your Elohim, even for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>that Yahweh your Elohim may show us the way in which we should walk, and the things that we should do.” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to Yahweh your Elohim according to your words; and it will happen that whatever thing Yahweh answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your Elohim sends you to tell us. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our Elohim, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our Elohim.” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>After ten days, Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>and said to them, “Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him, says: 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>‘If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Don’t be afraid of him,’ says Yahweh, ‘for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land. 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘But if you say, “We will not dwell in this land,” so that you don’t obey Yahweh your Elohim’s voice, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>saying, “No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there we will dwell;”&#160;’ 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>now therefore hear Yahweh’s word, O remnant of Judah! Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says, ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to live there, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will follow close behind you there in Egypt; and you will die there. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’ 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and my wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you, when you enter into Egypt; and you will be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, ‘Don’t go into Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have testified to you today. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your Elohim, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our Elohim; and according to all that Yahweh our Elohim says, so declare to us, and we will do it.’ 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed Yahweh your Elohim’s voice in anything for which he has sent me to you. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="43">43</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their Elohim, with which Yahweh their Elohim had sent him to them, even all these words, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely. Yahweh our Elohim has not sent you to say, ‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’ 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah—<sup>6&#160;</sup>the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>They came into the land of Egypt, for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice; and they came to Tahpanhes. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Take great stones in your hand and hide them in mortar in the brick work which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion over them. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will kindle a fire in the houses of the elohims of Egypt. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh that is in the land of Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the elohims of Egypt with fire.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="44">44</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah. Behold, today they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other elohims that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.” 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other elohims. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“Therefore now Yahweh, the Elohim of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Why do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave yourselves no one remaining, 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other elohims in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live, that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their women, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your women which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the Elohim of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I will take the remnant of Judah that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall in the land of Egypt. They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. They will be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will escape or be left to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for no one will return except those who will escape.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then all the men who knew that their women burned incense to other elohims, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“As for the word that you have spoken to us in Yahweh’s name, we will not listen to you. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.” 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The women said, “When we burned incense to the queen of the sky and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our men?” 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Then Jeremiah said to all the people—to the men and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,

<sup>59&#160;</sup>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster. 
<sup>60&#160;</sup>Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon. 
<sup>61&#160;</sup>Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words, 
<sup>62&#160;</sup>and say, ‘Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that no one will dwell in it, neither man nor animal, but that it will be desolate forever.’ 
<sup>63&#160;</sup>It will be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of the Euphrates. 
<sup>64&#160;</sup>Then you shall say, ‘Thus will Babylon sink, and will not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they will be weary.’&#160;” 
</p><p>Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="52">52</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign. He reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>For through Yahweh’s anger this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. 
</p><p>Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around. The men of war went toward the Arabah, 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He burned Yahweh’s house, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers. 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh’s house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house in pieces, and carried all of their bronze to Babylon. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, as gold, and that which was of silver, as silver. 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house. The bronze of all these vessels was without weight. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. The second pillar also had the same, with pomegranates. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around. 
</p><p>
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold, 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. 
</p><p>So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: 
</p><p class="m">in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews; 
</p><p class="m">
<sup>29&#160;</sup>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons; 
</p><p class="m">
<sup>30&#160;</sup>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five people. 
</p><p class="m">All the people numbered four thousand six hundred. 
</p><p>
<sup>31&#160;</sup>In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and released him from prison. 
<sup>32&#160;</sup>He spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon, 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.
