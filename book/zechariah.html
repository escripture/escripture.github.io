<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="1">1</h2>
<p class="p1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, Yehovah’s<span class="f">+ \fr 1:1 \ft “Yehovah” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> word came to the prophet Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying, 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>“Yehovah was very displeased with your fathers. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Therefore tell them, Yehovah of Armies says: ‘Return to me,’ says Yehovah of Armies, ‘and I will return to you,’ says Yehovah of Armies. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Don’t you be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: Yehovah of Armies says, ‘Return now from your evil ways and from your evil doings;’ but they didn’t hear nor listen to me, says Yehovah. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, didn’t they overtake your fathers? 
</p><p>“Then they repented and said, ‘Just as Yehovah of Armies determined to do to us, according to our ways and according to our practices, so he has dealt with us.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, Yehovah’s word came to the prophet Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying, 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>“I had a vision in the night, and behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:8 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in a ravine; and behind him there were red, brown, and white horses. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Then I asked, ‘My lord, what are these?’&#160;” 
</p><p>The angel who talked with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered, “They are the ones Yehovah has sent to go back and forth through the earth.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>They reported to Yehovah’s angel who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, “We have walked back and forth through the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and in peace.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Then Yehovah’s angel replied, “O Yehovah of Armies, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Yehovah answered the angel who talked with me with kind and comforting words. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>So the angel who talked with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Yehovah of Armies says: “I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, but they added to the calamity.” 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>Therefore Yehovah says: “I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy. My house shall be built in it,” says Yehovah of Armies, “and a line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>“Proclaim further, saying, ‘Yehovah of Armies says: “My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and Yehovah will again comfort Zion, and will again choose Jerusalem.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, four horns. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” 
</p><p>He answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Yehovah showed me four craftsmen. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Then I asked, “What are these coming to do?” 
</p><p>He said, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations that lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Then I asked, “Where are you going?” 
</p><p>He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him, 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>For I,’ says Yehovah, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the middle of her. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yehovah; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yehovah. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’ 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>For Yehovah of Armies says: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that Yehovah of Armies has sent me. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! For behold, I come and I will dwell within you,’ says Yehovah. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Many nations shall join themselves to Yehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell among you, and you shall know that Yehovah of Armies has sent me to you. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Yehovah will inherit Judah as his portion in the set-apart land, and will again choose Jerusalem. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Be silent, all flesh, before Yehovah; for he has roused himself from his set-apart habitation!” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before Yehovah’s angel, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Yehovah said to Satan, “Yehovah rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.” 
</p><p>So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and Yehovah’s angel was standing by. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Yehovah’s angel solemnly assured Joshua, saying, 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>“Yehovah of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign; for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua: on one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave its inscription,’ says Yehovah of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>In that day,’ says Yehovah of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>The angel who talked with me came again and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>He said to me, “What do you see?” 
</p><p>I said, “I have seen, and behold, a lamp stand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, “What are these, my lord?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?” 
</p><p>I said, “No, my lord.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is Yehovah’s word to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says Yehovah of Armies. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of ‘Grace, grace, to it!’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Moreover Yehovah’s word came to me, saying, 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that Yehovah of Armies has sent me to you. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Indeed, who despises the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are Yehovah’s eyes, which run back and forth through the whole earth.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>I asked him the second time, “What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts that pour the golden oil out of themselves?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?” 
</p><p>I said, “No, my lord.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord<span class="f">+ \fr 4:14 \ft The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”</span> of the whole earth.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Then again I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>He said to me, “What do you see?” 
</p><p>I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits,<span class="f">+ \fr 5:2 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</span> and its width ten cubits.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land, for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side; and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on the other side. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>I will cause it to go out,” says Yehovah of Armies, “and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it will remain in the middle of his house, and will destroy it with its timber and its stones.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, “Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that is appearing.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>I said, “What is it?” 
</p><p>He said, “This is the ephah<span class="f">+ \fr 5:6 \ft An ephah is a measure of volume of about 22 liters, 5.8 U. S. gallons, or about 2/3 of a bushel. </span> basket that is appearing.” He said moreover, “This is their appearance in all the land—<span class="v">7&#160;</span>and behold, a lead cover weighing one talent<span class="f">+ \fr 5:7 \ft A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds.</span> was lifted up—and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the ephah<span class="f">+ \fr 5:7 \ft 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel</span> basket.” 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>He said, “This is Wickedness;” and he threw her down into the middle of the ephah basket; and he threw the lead weight on its mouth. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there were two women; and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the sky. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are these carrying the ephah basket?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>In the first chariot were red horses. In the second chariot were black horses. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>In the third chariot were white horses. In the fourth chariot were dappled horses, all of them powerful. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward the south country.” 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth. He said, “Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Yehovah’s word came to me, saying, 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>“Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>and speak to him, saying, ‘Yehovah of Armies says, “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch! He will grow up out of his place; and he will build Yehovah’s temple. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He will build Yehovah’s temple. He will bear the glory, and will sit and rule on his throne. He will be a priest on his throne. The counsel of peace will be between them both. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>The crowns shall be to Helem, to Tobijah, to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in Yehovah’s temple. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Those who are far off shall come and build in Yehovah’s temple; and you shall know that Yehovah of Armies has sent me to you. This will happen, if you will diligently obey Yehovah your Elohim’s voice.”&#160;’&#160;”<span class="f">+ \fr 6:15 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="7">7</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>In the fourth year of King Darius, Yehovah’s word came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem Melech and their men to entreat Yehovah’s favor, 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>and to speak to the priests of the house of Yehovah of Armies and to the prophets, saying, “Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Then the word of Yehovah of Armies came to me, saying, 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>“Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these seventy years, did you at all fast to me, really to me? 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>When you eat and when you drink, don’t you eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves? 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Aren’t these the words which Yehovah proclaimed by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and its cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Yehovah’s word came to Zechariah, saying, 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>“Thus has Yehovah of Armies spoken, saying, ‘Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Don’t oppress the widow, the fatherless, the foreigner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.’ 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>But they refused to listen, and turned their backs, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Yes, they made their hearts as hard as flint, lest they might hear the law and the words which Yehovah of Armies had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from Yehovah of Armies. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>It has come to pass that, as he called and they refused to listen, so they will call and I will not listen,” said Yehovah of Armies; 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>“but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned; for they made the pleasant land desolate.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="8">8</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>The word of Yehovah of Armies came to me. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Yehovah says: “I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the middle of Jerusalem. Jerusalem shall be called ‘The City of Truth;’ and the mountain of Yehovah of Armies, ‘The Set-Apart Mountain.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand because of their old age. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes?” says Yehovah of Armies. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>I will bring them, and they will dwell within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their Elohim, in truth and in righteousness.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Yehovah of Armies was laid, even the temple, that it might be built. 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>For before those days there was no wages for man nor any wages for an animal, neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his neighbor. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days,” says Yehovah of Armies. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>“For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew. I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Don’t be afraid. Let your hands be strong.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>For Yehovah of Armies says: “As I thought to do evil to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath,” says Yehovah of Armies, “and I didn’t repent, 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Don’t be afraid. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates, 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath; for all these are things that I hate,” says Yehovah. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>The word of Yehovah of Armies came to me. 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months shall be for the house of Judah joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, ‘Let’s go speedily to entreat the favor of Yehovah, and to seek Yehovah of Armies. I will go also.’ 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yehovah of Armies in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of Yehovah.” 
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Yehovah of Armies says: “In those days, ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, ‘We will go with you, for we have heard that Elohim is with you.’&#160;”

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>A revelation.

<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Yehovah my Elohim says: “Feed the flock of slaughter. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be Yehovah, for I am rich;’ and their own shepherds don’t pity them. 
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,” says Yehovah; “but, behold, I will deliver every one of the men into his neighbor’s hand and into the hand of his king. They will strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>So I fed the flock to be slaughtered, especially the oppressed of the flock. I took for myself two staffs. The one I called “Favor” and the other I called “Union”, and I fed the flock. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Then I said, “I will not feed you. That which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those who are left eat each other’s flesh.” 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>I took my staff Favor and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was Yehovah’s word. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>I said to them, “If you think it best, give me my wages; and if not, keep them.” So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>Yehovah said to me, “Throw it to the potter—the handsome price that I was valued at by them!” I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in Yehovah’s house. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>Then I cut apart my other staff, Union, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Yehovah said to me, “Take for yourself yet again the equipment of a foolish shepherd. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land who will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the meat of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! The sword will strike his arm and his right eye. His arm will be completely withered, and his right eye will be totally blinded!”

<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>A revelation of Yehovah’s word concerning Israel: Yehovah, who stretches out the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him says: 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples, and it will also be on Judah in the siege against Jerusalem. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples. All who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>In that day,” says Yehovah, “I will strike every horse with terror and his rider with madness. I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>The chieftains of Judah will say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yehovah of Armies their Elohim.’ 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem will yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Yehovah also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of David’s house and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>In that day Yehovah will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He who is feeble among them at that day will be like David, and David’s house will be like Elohim, like Yehovah’s angel before them. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>It will happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>I will pour on David’s house and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication. They will look to me<span class="f">+ \fr 12:10 \ft After “me”, the Hebrew has the two letters “Aleph Tav” (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet), not as a word, but as a grammatical marker.</span> whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for his only son, and will grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for his firstborn. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>The land will mourn, every family apart; the family of David’s house apart, and their women apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their women apart; 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>the family of the house of Levi apart, and their women apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their women apart;

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>“In that day there will be a fountain opened to David’s house and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>It will come to pass in that day, says Yehovah of Armies, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they will be remembered no more. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>It will happen that when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, ‘You must die, because you speak lies in Yehovah’s name;’ and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they won’t wear a hairy mantle to deceive,

<span class="v">13&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that a great panic from Yehovah will be among them; and they will each seize the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
