<sup>1&#160;</sup>The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever: 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from Elohim the Father and from the Lord Yahushua Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Yahushua Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have Elohim. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen. </p></div><script src="../main.js"></script></body></html>
