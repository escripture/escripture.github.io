<h1 class="booklabel">Job</h1>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="1">1</h2>
<p class="p1">
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared Elohim,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:1 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “Elohim” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span> and turned away from evil. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. 
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. 
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced Elohim in their hearts.” Job did so continually. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Now on the day when Elohim’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:6 \ft “Yahweh” is Elohim’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span> Satan also came among them. 
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” 
</p><p>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears Elohim, and turns away from evil.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear Elohim for nothing? 
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold,<span class="f">+ \fr 1:12 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span> all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.” 
</p><p>So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of Elohim has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped. 
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.” 
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge Elohim with wrongdoing. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Again, on the day when Elohim’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” 
</p><p>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears Elohim, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. 
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes. 
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Then his woman said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce Elohim, and die.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of Elohim, and shall we not receive evil?” 
</p><p>In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him. 
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. 
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>Job answered: 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>“Let the day perish in which I was born, 
</p><p class="q2">the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Let that day be darkness. 
</p><p class="q2">Don’t let Elohim from above seek for it, 
</p><p class="q2">neither let the light shine on it. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. 
</p><p class="q2">Let a cloud dwell on it. 
</p><p class="q2">Let all that makes the day black terrify it. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. 
</p><p class="q2">Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. 
</p><p class="q2">Let it not come into the number of the months. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>Behold, let that night be barren. 
</p><p class="q2">Let no joyful voice come therein. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Let them curse it who curse the day, 
</p><p class="q2">who are ready to rouse up leviathan. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>Let the stars of its twilight be dark. 
</p><p class="q2">Let it look for light, but have none, 
</p><p class="q2">neither let it see the eyelids of the morning, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, 
</p><p class="q2">nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>“Why didn’t I die from the womb? 
</p><p class="q2">Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>Why did the knees receive me? 
</p><p class="q2">Or why the breast, that I should nurse? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>For now I should have lain down and been quiet. 
</p><p class="q2">I should have slept, then I would have been at rest, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>with kings and counselors of the earth, 
</p><p class="q2">who built up waste places for themselves; 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>or with princes who had gold, 
</p><p class="q2">who filled their houses with silver; 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, 
</p><p class="q2">as infants who never saw light. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>There the wicked cease from troubling. 
</p><p class="q2">There the weary are at rest. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>There the prisoners are at ease together. 
</p><p class="q2">They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>The small and the great are there. 
</p><p class="q2">The servant is free from his master. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>“Why is light given to him who is in misery, 
</p><p class="q2">life to the bitter in soul, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>who long for death, but it doesn’t come; 
</p><p class="q2">and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">22&#160;</span>who rejoice exceedingly, 
</p><p class="q2">and are glad, when they can find the grave? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">23&#160;</span>Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, 
</p><p class="q2">whom Elohim has hedged in? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">24&#160;</span>For my sighing comes before I eat. 
</p><p class="q2">My groanings are poured out like water. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">25&#160;</span>For the thing which I fear comes on me, 
</p><p class="q2">that which I am afraid of comes to me. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">26&#160;</span>I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest; 
</p><p class="q2">but trouble comes.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p>
<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? 
</p><p class="q2">But who can withhold himself from speaking? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>Behold, you have instructed many, 
</p><p class="q2">you have strengthened the weak hands. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>Your words have supported him who was falling, 
</p><p class="q2">you have made the feeble knees firm. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>But now it has come to you, and you faint. 
</p><p class="q2">It touches you, and you are troubled. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Isn’t your piety your confidence? 
</p><p class="q2">Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope? 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? 
</p><p class="q2">Or where were the upright cut off? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity 
</p><p class="q2">and sow trouble, reap the same. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>By the breath of Elohim they perish. 
</p><p class="q2">By the blast of his anger are they consumed. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>The roaring of the lion, 
</p><p class="q2">and the voice of the fierce lion, 
</p><p class="q2">the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>The old lion perishes for lack of prey. 
</p><p class="q2">The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p class="q1">
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>“Now a thing was secretly brought to me. 
</p><p class="q2">My ear received a whisper of it. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>In thoughts from the visions of the night, 
</p><p class="q2">when deep sleep falls on men, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>fear came on me, and trembling, 
</p><p class="q2">which made all my bones shake. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>Then a spirit passed before my face. 
</p><p class="q2">The hair of my flesh stood up. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. 
</p><p class="q2">A form was before my eyes. 
</p><p class="q2">Silence, then I heard a voice, saying, 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>‘Shall mortal man be more just than Elohim? 
</p><p class="q2">Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">18&#160;</span>Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. 
</p><p class="q2">He charges his angels with error. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">19&#160;</span>How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, 
</p><p class="q2">whose foundation is in the dust, 
</p><p class="q2">who are crushed before the moth! 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">20&#160;</span>Between morning and evening they are destroyed. 
</p><p class="q2">They perish forever without any regarding it. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">21&#160;</span>Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them? 
</p><p class="q2">They die, and that without wisdom.’

</p><p class="q2">To which of the set-apart ones will you turn? 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">2&#160;</span>For resentment kills the foolish man,

</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>I have seen the foolish taking root,

<span class="v">1&#160;</span>Then Job answered Yahweh:

<span class="v">2&#160;</span>“I know that you can do all things, 
</p><p class="q2">and that no purpose of yours can be restrained. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">3&#160;</span>You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’ 
</p><p class="q2">therefore I have uttered that which I didn’t understand, 
</p><p class="q2">things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">4&#160;</span>You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak; 
</p><p class="q2">I will question you, and you will answer me.’ 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">5&#160;</span>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, 
</p><p class="q2">but now my eye sees you. 
</p><p class="q1">
<span class="v">6&#160;</span>Therefore I abhor myself, 
</p><p class="q2">and repent in dust and ashes.” 
</p><div class="b"> &#160; </div>
<p>
<span class="v">7&#160;</span>It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has. 
<span class="v">8&#160;</span>Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.” 
</p><p>
<span class="v">9&#160;</span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">10&#160;</span>Yahweh restored Job’s prosperity when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
<span class="v">11&#160;</span>Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,<span class="f">+ \fr 42:11 \ft literally, kesitah, a unit of money, probably silver</span> and everyone a ring of gold. 
</p><p>
<span class="v">12&#160;</span>So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. 
<span class="v">13&#160;</span>He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
<span class="v">14&#160;</span>He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch. 
<span class="v">15&#160;</span>In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. 
<span class="v">16&#160;</span>After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations. 
<span class="v">17&#160;</span>So Job died, being old and full of days. </p></div></body></html>
