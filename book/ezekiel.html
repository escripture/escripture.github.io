<p class="p1">
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of Elohim. 
</p><p>
<sup>2&#160;</sup>In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and Yahuah’s hand was there on him. 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it, and out of the middle of it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had their faces and their wings like this: 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went. Each one went straight forward. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion on the right side. The four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Each one went straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They didn’t turn when they went. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. The fire went up and down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four of them had one likeness. Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when they went. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around. 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there. The wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
</p><p>
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like an awesome crystal to look at, stretched out over their heads above. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their bodies on that side. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings. 
</p><p>
<sup>25&#160;</sup>There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. 
</p><p>This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahuah’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="2">2</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.” 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me. 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahuah says.’ 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse—for they are a rebellious house—yet they will know that there has been a prophet among them. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.” 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations, mourning, and woe were written in it. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="3">3</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” 
</p><p>
<sup>2&#160;</sup>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll. 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your belly and your bowels with it.” 
</p><p>Then I ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel—<sup>6&#160;</sup>not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard-hearted. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahuah says,’ whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse.” 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, “Blessed be Yahuah’s glory from his place.” 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and Yahuah’s hand was strong on me. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv who lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days. 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>At the end of seven days, Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.” 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.” 
</p><p>
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s hand was there on me; and he said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.” 
</p><p>
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, Yahuah’s glory stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. Then I fell on my face. 
</p><p>
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and will not be able to correct them, for they are a rebellious house. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahuah says.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="4">4</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it and plant battering rams against it all around. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Take for yourself an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city. Then set your face toward it. It will be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. According to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it. According to the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day. From time to time you shall eat it. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. From time to time you shall drink. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.” 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Yahuah said, “Even thus will the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.” 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahuah! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals. No abominable meat has come into my mouth!” 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.” 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness. They will drink water by measure, and in dismay; 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="5">5</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor to yourself, and shall cause it to pass over your head and over your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>You shall take a small number of these and bind them in the folds of your robe. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a fire will come out into all the house of Israel. 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“The Lord Yahuah says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that are around you; 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>therefore the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything like it any more, because of all your abominations. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you; and I will scatter the whole remnant of you to all the winds. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Therefore as I live,’ says the Lord Yahuah, ‘surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed with famine within you. A third part will fall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them. 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will know that I, Yahuah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them. 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, Yahuah, have spoken it—<sup>16&#160;</sup>when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. I will increase the famine on you and will break your staff of bread. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood will pass through you. I will bring the sword on you. I, Yahuah, have spoken it.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="6">6</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahuah! The Lord Yahuah says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>They will know that I am Yahuah. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“The Lord Yahuah says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!”, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>You will know that I am Yahuah when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak—the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will stretch out my hand on them and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations. Then they will know that I am Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<h2 class="chapterlabel" id="7">7</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“You, son of man, the Lord Yahuah says to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I am Yahuah.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“The Lord Yahuah says: ‘A disaster! A unique disaster! Behold, it comes. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways. Your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I, Yahuah, strike. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Pride has budded. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There will be nothing of value among them. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision concerns the whole multitude of it. None will return. None will strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle, for my wrath is on all its multitude. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within. He who is in the field will die by the sword. He who is in the city will be devoured by famine and pestilence. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>But of those who escape, they will escape and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold won’t be able to deliver them in the day of Yahuah’s wrath. They won’t satisfy their souls or fill their bellies; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein. Therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they will profane it. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place. Robbers will enter into it, and profane it. 
</p><p>
<sup>23&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Make chains, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong to cease. Their set-apart places will be profaned. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Mischief will come on mischief, and rumor will be on rumor. They will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The hands of the people of the land will be troubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments I will judge them. Then they will know that I am Yahuah.’&#160;”

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, the Lord Yahuah’s hand fell on me there. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire—from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire, and from his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of Elohim to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north, where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Behold, the glory of the Elohim of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain. 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.” 
</p><p>So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great abominations.” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.” 
</p><p>When I had dug in the wall, I saw a door. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? For they say, ‘Yahuah doesn’t see us. Yahuah has forsaken the land.’&#160;” 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations which they do.” 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahuah’s house which was toward the north; and I saw the women sit there weeping for Tammuz. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see yet greater abominations than these.” 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>He brought me into the inner court of Yahuah’s house; and I saw at the door of Yahuah’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs toward Yahuah’s temple and their faces toward the east. They were worshiping the sun toward the east. 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger. Behold, they put the branch to their nose. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="9">9</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.” 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar. 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>The glory of the Elohim of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahuah said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done within it.” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have pity. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” 
</p><p>Then they began at the old men who were before the house. 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” 
</p><p>They went out, and struck in the city. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lord Yahuah! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?” 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘Yahuah has forsaken the land, and Yahuah doesn’t see.’ 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you have commanded me.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="10">10</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” 
</p><p>He went in as I watched. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahuah’s glory. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of Elohim Almighty when he speaks. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” that he went in and stood beside a wheel. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t turn as they went. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them. 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahuah’s house; and the glory of the Elohim of Israel was over them above. 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>This is the living creature that I saw under the Elohim of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="11">11</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Moreover the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of Yahuah’s house, which looks eastward. Behold, twenty-five men were at the door of the gate; and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city; 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’ 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s Spirit fell on me, and he said to me, “Speak, ‘Yahuah says: “Thus you have said, house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: “Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the meat, and this is the cauldron; but you will be brought out of the middle of it. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahuah. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle of it. I will judge you in the border of Israel. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>You will know that I am Yahuah, for you have not walked in my statutes. You have not executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord Yahuah! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?” 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are the ones to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from Yahuah. This land has been given to us for a possession.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.” 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh, 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their Elohim. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way on their own heads,’ says the Lord Yahuah.” 
</p><p>
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them. The glory of the Elohim of Israel was over them above. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s glory went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of Elohim into Chaldea, to the captives. 
</p><p>So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Then I spoke to the captives all the things that Yahuah had shown me. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="12">12</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word also came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear, and don’t hear; for they are a rebellious house. 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>“Therefore, you son of man, prepare your baggage for moving, and move by day in their sight. You shall move from your place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for moving. You shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as when men go out into exile. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your baggage out that way. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face, so that you don’t see the land, for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.” 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>In the morning, Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘The prince who is among them will bear his baggage on his shoulder in the dark, and will go out. They will dig through the wall to carry things out that way. He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his bands. I will draw out the sword after them. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘They will know that I am Yahuah when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. Then they will know that I am Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Tell the people of the land, ‘The Lord Yahuah says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the land of Israel: “They will eat their bread with fearfulness and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that is therein, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>The cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation. Then you will know that I am Yahuah.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>“Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’? 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Tell them therefore, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel;”&#160;’ but tell them, ‘&#160;“The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>For I am Yahuah. I will speak, and the word that I speak will be performed. It will be no more deferred; for in your days, rebellious house, I will speak the word and will perform it,” says the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Again Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>“Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “None of my words will be deferred any more, but the word which I speak will be performed,” says the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="13">13</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear Yahuah’s word: 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>The Lord Yahuah says, “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>You have not gone up into the gaps or built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in Yahuah’s day. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, ‘Yahuah says;’ but Yahuah has not sent them. They have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Haven’t you seen a false vision, and haven’t you spoken a lying divination, in that you say, ‘Yahuah says;’ but I have not spoken?” 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: “Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who utter lying divinations. They will not be in the council of my people, neither will they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahuah.” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace;” and there is no peace. When one builds up a wall, behold, they plaster it with whitewash. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will be an overflowing shower; and you, great hailstones, will fall. A stormy wind will tear it. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it?” 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath. There will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>So I will break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered. It will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know that I am Yahuah. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered it with whitewash. I will tell you, ‘The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it—<sup>16&#160;</sup>to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,’&#160;” says the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them, 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>and say, “The Lord Yahuah says: ‘Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all elbows and make veils for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people and save souls alive for yourselves? 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Behold, I am against your magic bands, with which you hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms. I will let the souls fly free, even the souls whom you ensnare like birds. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>I will also tear your veils and deliver my people out of your hand; and they will no longer be in your hand to be ensnared. Then you will know that I am Yahuah. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="14">14</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>“Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. Should I be inquired of at all by them? 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face then comes to the prophet, I Yahuah will answer him there according to the multitude of his idols, 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Return, and turn yourselves from your idols! Turn away your faces from all your abominations.

<sup>7&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live in Israel, who separates himself from me and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of me, I Yahuah will answer him by myself. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I will set my face against that man and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from among my people. Then you will know that I am Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“If the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, Yahuah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from among my people Israel. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>They will bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet will be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him, 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their Elohim,” says the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of its bread and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and animal—<sup>14&#160;</sup>though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they ravage it and it is made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the animals—<sup>16&#160;</sup>though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahuah, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate. 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>“Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land, so that I cut off from it man and animal’—<sup>18&#160;</sup>though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahuah, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only would be delivered themselves. 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal—<sup>20&#160;</sup>though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahuah, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness.” 
</p><p>
<sup>21&#160;</sup>For the Lord Yahuah says: “How much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem—the sword, the famine, the evil animals, and the pestilence—to cut off from it man and animal! 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Yet, behold, there will be left a remnant in it that will be carried out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they will come out to you, and you will see their way and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>They will comfort you, when you see their way and their doings; then you will know that I have not done all that I have done in it without cause,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="15">15</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it? 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and the middle of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work? 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it has been burned, will it yet be suitable for any work?” 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: “As the vine wood among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the fire will still devour them. Then you will know that I am Yahuah, when I set my face against them. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="16">16</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Again Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations; 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and say, ‘The Lord Yahuah says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite. An Amorite was your father, and your mother was a Hittite. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. You weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. You weren’t salted at all, nor wrapped in blankets at all. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, because you were abhorred in the day that you were born. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent beauty. Your breasts were formed, and your hair grew; yet you were naked and bare. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my garment over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I pledged myself to you and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord Yahuah, “and you became mine. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Then I washed you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>I clothed you also with embroidered work and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered you with silk. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>I decked you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and put a chain on your neck. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>I put a ring on your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered work. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Your renown went out among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by. It was his. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors, and played the prostitute on them. This shouldn’t happen, neither shall it be. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and played the prostitute with them. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma; and so it was,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter, 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>that you have slain my children and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them? 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were wallowing in your blood. 
</p><p>
<sup>23&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“It has happened after all your wickedness—woe, woe to you!” says the Lord Yahuah—<sup>24&#160;</sup>“that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your portion, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren’t satisfied. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren’t satisfied with this. 
</p><p>
<sup>30&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“How weak is your heart,” says the Lord Yahuah, “since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute; 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay. 
</p><p>
<sup>32&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Adulterous woman, who takes strangers instead of her man! 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>People give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>35&#160;</sup>“Therefore, prostitute, hear Yahuah’s word: 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>‘The Lord Yahuah says, “Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them; 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those whom you have loved, with all those whom you have hated. I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>I will judge you as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places. They will strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels. They will leave you naked and bare. 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords. 
<sup>41&#160;</sup>They will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute, and you will also give no hire any more. 
<sup>42&#160;</sup>So I will cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you. I will be quiet, and will not be angry any more. 
</p><p>
<sup>43&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way on your head,” says the Lord Yahuah: “and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations. 
</p><p>
<sup>44&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’ 
<sup>45&#160;</sup>You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her man and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their men and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. 
<sup>46&#160;</sup>Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, is Sodom with her daughters. 
<sup>47&#160;</sup>Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor done their abominations; but soon you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. 
<sup>48&#160;</sup>As I live,” says the Lord Yahuah, “Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters. 
</p><p>
<sup>49&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters. She also didn’t strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. 
<sup>50&#160;</sup>They were arrogant and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away when I saw it. 
<sup>51&#160;</sup>Samaria hasn’t committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done. 
<sup>52&#160;</sup>You also bear your own shame yourself, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you. Yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters. 
</p><p>
<sup>53&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“I will reverse their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives among them; 
<sup>54&#160;</sup>that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them. 
<sup>55&#160;</sup>Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate. 
<sup>56&#160;</sup>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride, 
<sup>57&#160;</sup>before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you all around. 
<sup>58&#160;</sup>You have borne your lewdness and your abominations,” says Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>59&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘For the Lord Yahuah says: “I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant. 
<sup>60&#160;</sup>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
<sup>61&#160;</sup>Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant. 
<sup>62&#160;</sup>I will establish my covenant with you. Then you will know that I am Yahuah; 
<sup>63&#160;</sup>that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done,” says the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="17">17</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, tell a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel; 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>and say, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “A great eagle with great wings and long feathers, full of feathers which had various colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He cropped off the topmost of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of traffic. He planted it in a city of merchants. 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“He also took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>It grew and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine, produced branches, and shot out sprigs. 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot out its branches toward him, from the ground where it was planted, that he might water it. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might produce branches and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a good vine.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Say, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Will it prosper? Won’t he pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, that it may wither, that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? It can’t be raised from its roots by a strong arm or many people. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Yes, behold, being planted, will it prosper? Won’t it utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the ground where it grew.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Moreover Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Don’t you know what these things mean?’ Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to him to Babylon. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He took one of the royal offspring, and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land, 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>that the kingdom might be brought low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the covenant, and still escape? 
</p><p>
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘As I live,’ says the Lord Yahuah, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he will die. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company won’t help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things. He won’t escape. 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>“Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: ‘As I live, I will surely bring on his own head my oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>I will spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>All his fugitives in all his bands will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered toward every wind. Then you will know that I, Yahuah, have spoken it.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>22&#160;</sup>“The Lord Yahuah says: ‘I will also take some of the lofty top of the cedar, and will plant it. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>I will plant it in the mountain of the height of Israel; and it will produce boughs, and bear fruit, and be a good cedar. Birds of every kind will dwell in the shade of its branches. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>All the trees of the field will know that I, Yahuah, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree flourish.

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahuah, and sat before me. 
</p><p>
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Is it to inquire of me that you have come? As I live,” says the Lord Yahuah, “I will not be inquired of by you.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>“Will you judge them, son of man? Will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Tell them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, ‘I am Yahuah your Elohim;’ 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>in that day I swore to them to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Yahuah your Elohim.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“But they rebelled against me and wouldn’t listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes. They also didn’t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahuah who sanctifies them.

<sup>13&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them. I didn’t make a full end of them in the wilderness. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers. Don’t observe their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>I am Yahuah your Elohim. Walk in my statutes, keep my ordinances, and do them. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Make my Sabbaths set-apart. They shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am Yahuah your Elohim.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>21&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“But the children rebelled against me. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and didn’t keep my ordinances to do them, which if a man does, he shall live in them. They profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Nevertheless I withdrew my hand and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries, 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they couldn’t live. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahuah.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>27&#160;</sup>“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Moreover, in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There they also made their pleasant aroma, and there they poured out their drink offerings. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>Then I said to them, ‘What does the high place where you go mean?’ So its name is called Bamah to this day.”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>30&#160;</sup>“Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? Do you play the prostitute after their abominations? 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>When you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? Should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord Yahuah, I will not be inquired of by you!

<sup>32&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“That which comes into your mind will not be at all, in that you say, ‘We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.’ 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>As I live,” says the Lord Yahuah, “surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out. 
<sup>35&#160;</sup>I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face. 
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>“I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who disobey me. I will bring them out of the land where they live, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahuah.”

<sup>39&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘As for you, house of Israel, the Lord Yahuah says: “Go, everyone serve his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me; but you shall no more profane my set-apart name with your gifts and with your idols.

<sup>18&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me again, saying,

<sup>20&#160;</sup>You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows back and forth. He consulted the teraphim. He looked in the liver. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>In his right hand was the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, and to build forts. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>It will be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken.

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came again to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their youthful nipples were caressed there. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>“Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors, 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>who were clothed with blue—governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>She gave herself as a prostitute to them, all of them the choicest men of Assyria. She defiled herself with the idols of whoever she lusted after. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They caressed her youthful nipples and they poured out their prostitution on her. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>“Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians on whom she doted. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her. 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting than she, and in her prostitution which was more depraved than the prostitution of her sister. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers—her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way. 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with red, 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>dressed with belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them into Chaldea. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution. She was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>So she uncovered her prostitution and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just like my soul was alienated from her sister. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing of your nipples by the Egyptians because of your youthful breasts. 
</p><p>
<sup>22&#160;</sup>“Therefore, Oholibah, the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side: 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you with buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their judgments. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will take away your nose and your ears. Your remnant will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and the rest of you will be devoured by the fire. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“For the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated. 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>These things will be done to you because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>32&#160;</sup>“The Lord Yahuah says: 
</p><p class="q1">‘You will drink of your sister’s cup, 
</p><p class="q2">which is deep and large. 
</p><p class="q1">You will be ridiculed and held in derision. 
</p><p class="q2">It contains much. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>33&#160;</sup>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, 
</p><p class="q2">with the cup of astonishment and desolation, 
</p><p class="q2">with the cup of your sister Samaria. 
</p><p class="q1">
<sup>34&#160;</sup>You will even drink it and drain it out. 
</p><p class="q2">You will gnaw the broken pieces of it, 
</p><p class="q2">and will tear your breasts; 
</p><p class="m">for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>35&#160;</sup>“Therefore the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>36&#160;</sup>Yahuah said moreover to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured. 
<sup>38&#160;</sup>Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, they have done this in the middle of my house. 
</p><p>
<sup>40&#160;</sup>“Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments, 
<sup>41&#160;</sup>and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil. 
</p><p>
<sup>42&#160;</sup>“The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
<sup>43&#160;</sup>Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the prostitute with her, and she with them.’ 
<sup>44&#160;</sup>They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women. 
<sup>45&#160;</sup>Righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. 
</p><p>
<sup>46&#160;</sup>“For the Lord Yahuah says: ‘I will bring up a mob against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed. 
<sup>47&#160;</sup>The company will stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords. They will kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
</p><p>
<sup>48&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to be lewd like you. 
<sup>49&#160;</sup>They will recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of your idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;”

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Yahuah’s word came to me, saying,

<sup>6&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Therefore the Lord Yahuah says:

<sup>8&#160;</sup>That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,

<sup>9&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Therefore the Lord Yahuah says:

<sup>13&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest. 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“I, Yahuah, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Also Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.” 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my woman died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded. 
</p><p>
<sup>19&#160;</sup>The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things mean to us, that you act like this?” 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Then I said to them, “Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord Yahuah says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.

<sup>23&#160;</sup>Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord Yahuah.’&#160;”&#160;’&#160;”

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying,

<sup>3&#160;</sup>Tell the children of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahuah! The Lord Yahuah says, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity,

<sup>8&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,’

<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the eleventh year, in the first of the month, Yahuah’s word came to me, saying,

<sup>3&#160;</sup>therefore the Lord Yahuah says, ‘Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>They will destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahuah. ‘She will become plunder for the nations. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Her daughters who are in the field will be slain with the sword. Then they will know that I am Yahuah.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“For the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, with chariots, with horsemen, and an army with many people.

<sup>9&#160;</sup>He will set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>By reason of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he enters into your gates, as men enter into a city which is broken open. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>He will tread down all your streets with the hoofs of his horses. He will kill your people with the sword. The pillars of your strength will go down to the ground. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>They will make a plunder of your riches and make a prey of your merchandise. They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. They will lay your stones, your timber, and your dust in the middle of the waters. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>I will cause the noise of your songs to cease. The sound of your harps won’t be heard any more. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will make you a bare rock. You will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more; for I Yahuah have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahuah.

<sup>15&#160;</sup>“The Lord Yahuah says to Tyre: ‘Won’t the islands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made within you? 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling. They will sit on the ground, and will tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying, 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>“Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman, 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet and warns the people, 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and doesn’t heed the warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>He heard the sound of the trumpet and didn’t take warning. His blood will be on him; whereas if he had heeded the warning, he would have delivered his soul. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>But if the watchman sees the sword come and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’ 
</p><p>
<sup>7&#160;</sup>“So you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warnings from me. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at your hand. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: ‘You say this, “Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?”&#160;’ 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Tell them, ‘&#160;“As I live,” says the Lord Yahuah, “I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, house of Israel?”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“You, son of man, tell the children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his disobedience. And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither will he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>When I tell the righteous that he will surely live, if he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but he will die in his iniquity that he has committed. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Again, when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die,” if he turns from his sin and does that which is lawful and right, 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity, he will surely live. He will not die.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying,

<sup>3&#160;</sup>You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fatlings, but you don’t feed the sheep. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>You haven’t strengthened the diseased. You haven’t healed that which was sick. You haven’t bound up that which was broken. You haven’t brought back that which was driven away. You haven’t sought that which was lost, but you have ruled over them with force and with rigor. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>They were scattered, because there was no shepherd. They became food to all the animals of the field, and were scattered. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>My sheep wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth. There was no one who searched or sought.”

<sup>7&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahuah’s word:

<sup>10&#160;</sup>The Lord Yahuah says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds. I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. The shepherds won’t feed themselves any more. I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.” 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘For the Lord Yahuah says: “Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.

<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will feed them with good pasture, and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel. There they will lie down in a good fold. They will feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will feed them in justice.”&#160;’

<sup>17&#160;</sup>“As for you, O my flock, the Lord Yahuah says: ‘Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats.

<sup>7&#160;</sup>So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, there was an earthquake. Then the bones came together, bone to its bone. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. 
</p><p>
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”&#160;’&#160;” 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army. 
</p><p>
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are completely cut off.’ 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>You will know that I am Yahuah, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. Then I will place you in your own land; and you will know that I, Yahuah, have spoken it and performed it,” says Yahuah.’&#160;” 
</p><p class="b"> &#160; </p>
<p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came again to me, saying, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>“You, son of man, take one stick and write on it, ‘For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions.’ Then take another stick, and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions.’ 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then join them for yourself to one another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>“When the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Won’t you show us what you mean by these?’ 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>tell them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.”&#160;’ 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. One king will be king to them all. They will no longer be two nations. They won’t be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>They won’t defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they will be my people, and I will be their Elohim. 
</p><p>
<sup>24&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“My servant David will be king over them. They all will have one shepherd. They will also walk in my ordinances and observe my statutes, and do them. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>They will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived. They will dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, forever. David my servant will be their prince forever. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will place them, multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forever more. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>My tent also will be with them. I will be their Elohim, and they will be my people. 
<sup>28&#160;</sup>The nations will know that I am Yahuah who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forever more.”&#160;’&#160;”

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s word came to me, saying,

<sup>13&#160;</sup>Sheba, Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, will ask you, ‘Have you come to take the plunder? Have you assembled your company to take the prey, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder?’&#160;”&#160;’ 
</p><p>
<sup>14&#160;</sup>“Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “In that day when my people Israel dwells securely, will you not know it?

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck, in the same day, Yahuah’s hand was on me, and he brought me there. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>In the visions of Elohim he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was something like the frame of a city to the south. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand width each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>The side rooms of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. The posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the side rooms, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>He measured the gate from the roof of the one side room to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>There were closed windows to the side rooms, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches. Windows were around inward. Palm trees were on each post. 
</p><p>
<sup>17&#160;</sup>Then he brought me into the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirty rooms were on the pavement. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north. 
</p><p>
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces toward the north. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side. Its posts and its arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>Its windows, its arches, and its palm trees were the same as the measure of the gate which faces toward the east. They went up to it by seven steps. Its arches were before them. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate. 
</p><p>
<sup>24&#160;</sup>He led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its posts and its arches according to these measurements. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like the other windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. It had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>There was a gate to the inner court toward the south. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate toward the south. 
</p><p>
<sup>28&#160;</sup>Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate according to these measurements; 
<sup>29&#160;</sup>with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide. 
<sup>30&#160;</sup>There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide. 
<sup>31&#160;</sup>Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts. The ascent to it had eight steps. 
</p><p>
<sup>32&#160;</sup>He brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured the gate according to these measurements; 
<sup>33&#160;</sup>with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide. 
<sup>34&#160;</sup>Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps. 
</p><p>
<sup>35&#160;</sup>He brought me to the north gate, and he measured it according to these measurements—<sup>36&#160;</sup>its lodges, its posts, and its arches. There were windows in it all around. The length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. 
<sup>37&#160;</sup>Its posts were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps. 
</p><p>
<sup>38&#160;</sup>A room with its door was by the posts at the gates. They washed the burnt offering there. 
<sup>39&#160;</sup>In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. 
<sup>40&#160;</sup>On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. 
<sup>41&#160;</sup>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate: eight tables, on which they killed the sacrifices. 
<sup>42&#160;</sup>There were four cut stone tables for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. They laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them. 
<sup>43&#160;</sup>The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around. The meat of the offering was on the tables. 
</p><p>
<sup>44&#160;</sup>Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate. They faced toward the south. One at the side of the east gate faced toward the north. 
<sup>45&#160;</sup>He said to me, “This room, which faces toward the south, is for the priests who perform the duty of the house. 
<sup>46&#160;</sup>The room which faces toward the north is for the priests who perform the duty of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahuah to minister to him.” 
<sup>47&#160;</sup>He measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, square. The altar was before the house. 
</p><p>
<sup>48&#160;</sup>Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. 
<sup>49&#160;</sup>The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits, even by the steps by which they went up to it. There were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="41">41</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>He brought me to the nave and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tent. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits. 
</p><p>
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Then he went inward and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the nave. He said to me, “This is the most set-apart place.” 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in each story. They entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported and not penetrate the wall of the house. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level. 
</p><p>
<sup>8&#160;</sup>I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits. That which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house. 
<sup>10&#160;</sup>Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits. 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long; 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>also the width of the face of the temple, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits. 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court, 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, opposite the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered), 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces, 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The wall of the temple was like this. 
</p><p>
<sup>21&#160;</sup>The door posts of the nave were squared. As for the face of the nave, its appearance was as the appearance of the temple. 
<sup>22&#160;</sup>The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before Yahuah.” 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other. 
<sup>25&#160;</sup>There were made on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees, like those made on the walls. There was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. This is how the side rooms of the temple and the thresholds were arranged. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="42">42</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north. Then he brought me into the room that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Facing the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the three stories. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these more than from the lower and the middle in the building. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, was fifty cubits long. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. Behold, those facing the temple were one hundred cubits. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were rooms. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north. Their length and width were the same. All their exits had the same arrangement and doors. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Like the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them. 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>Then he said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate place, are the set-apart rooms, where the priests who are near to Yahuah shall eat the most set-apart things. There they shall lay the most set-apart things, with the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is set-apart. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the set-apart place into the outer court until they lay their garments in which they minister there; for they are set-apart. Then they shall put on other garments, and shall approach that which is for the people.” 
</p><p>
<sup>15&#160;</sup>Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it all around. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around. 
<sup>18&#160;</sup>He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, the length five hundred cubits, and the width five hundred cubits, to make a separation between that which was set-apart and that which was common. 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="43">43</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Behold, the glory of the Elohim of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illuminated with his glory. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Yahuah’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward the east. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>The Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, Yahuah’s glory filled the house. 
</p><p>
<sup>6&#160;</sup>I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and a man stood by me. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no more defile my set-apart name, neither they nor their kings, by their prostitution and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places; 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>in their setting of their threshold by my threshold and their door post beside my door post. There was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled my set-apart name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in my anger. 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings far from me. Then I will dwell among them forever. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, its fashion, its exits, its entrances, its structure, all its ordinances, all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them. 
</p><p>
<sup>12&#160;</sup>“This is the law of the house. On the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most set-apart. Behold, this is the law of the house. 
</p><p>
<sup>13&#160;</sup>“These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a hand width): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border around its edge a span; and this shall be the base of the altar. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the width a cubit. 
<sup>15&#160;</sup>The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns. 
<sup>16&#160;</sup>The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides. 
<sup>17&#160;</sup>The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit around; and its steps shall look toward the east.” 
</p><p>
<sup>18&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahuah says: ‘These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it. 
<sup>19&#160;</sup>You shall give to the Levitical priests who are of the offspring of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me,’ says the Lord Yahuah, ‘a young bull for a sin offering. 
<sup>20&#160;</sup>You shall take of its blood and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around. You shall cleanse it and make atonement for it that way. 
<sup>21&#160;</sup>You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside of the sanctuary. 
</p><p>
<sup>22&#160;</sup>“On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without defect and a ram out of the flock without defect. 
<sup>24&#160;</sup>You shall bring them near to Yahuah, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>25&#160;</sup>“Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering. They shall also prepare a young bull and a ram out of the flock, without defect. 
<sup>26&#160;</sup>Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it. So shall they consecrate it. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar and your peace offerings. Then I will accept you,’ says the Lord Yahuah.” 
</p><h2 class="chapterlabel" id="44">44</h2>
<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Yahuah said to me, “This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, no man shall enter in by it; for Yahuah, the Elohim of Israel, has entered in by it. Therefore it shall be shut. 
<sup>3&#160;</sup>As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before Yahuah. He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out the same way.” 
</p><p>
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahuah’s glory filled Yahuah’s house; so I fell on my face. 
</p><p>
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Yahuah said to me, “Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning all the ordinances of Yahuah’s house and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary. 
<sup>6&#160;</sup>You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahuah says: “You house of Israel, let that be enough of all your abominations, 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood; and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations. 
<sup>8&#160;</sup>You have not performed the duty of my set-apart things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.” 
<sup>9&#160;</sup>The Lord Yahuah says, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel. 
</p><p>
<sup>10&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“But the Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity. 
<sup>11&#160;</sup>Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. 
<sup>12&#160;</sup>Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up my hand against them,” says the Lord Yahuah, “and they will bear their iniquity. 
<sup>13&#160;</sup>They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my set-apart things, to the things that are most set-apart; but they will bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed. 
<sup>14&#160;</sup>Yet I will make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service and for all that will be done therein.

<sup>15&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me. They shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood,” says the Lord Yahuah.

<sup>17&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“It will be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments. No wool shall come on them while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

<sup>19&#160;</sup>When they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they minister and lay them in the set-apart rooms. They shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people with their garments.

<sup>22&#160;</sup>They shall not take for their women a widow, or her who is put away; but they shall take virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest. 
<sup>23&#160;</sup>They shall teach my people the difference between the set-apart and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

<sup>26&#160;</sup>After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days. 
<sup>27&#160;</sup>In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,” says the Lord Yahuah. 
</p><p>
<sup>28&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘They shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel. I am their possession.

<p>
<sup>1&#160;</sup>“&#160;‘&#160;“Moreover, when you divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an offering to Yahuah, a set-apart portion of the land.

<sup>1&#160;</sup>He brought me back to the door of the temple; and behold, waters flowed out from under the threshold of the temple eastward, for the front of the temple faced toward the east. The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of the temple, on the south of the altar. 
<sup>2&#160;</sup>Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side.

<sup>3&#160;</sup>When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. 
<sup>4&#160;</sup>Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist. 
<sup>5&#160;</sup>Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be walked through.

<sup>6&#160;</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” 
</p><p>Then he brought me and caused me to return to the bank of the river. 
<sup>7&#160;</sup>Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
