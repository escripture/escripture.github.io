# design goals


# ANY VERSION
# don't add to scripture!
#   no "plan of salvation" other than scripture itself!
#   no subject headings, in-text or otherwise
#   no book introductions, commentary, etc.
# no starting all verses on a new line

# UNDECIDED
# source language in parallel or interlinear
# no unnecessary preface, strictly business. postface instead of preface.

# READERS VERSION (by far the main goal of this project)
# no verse or chapter numbers in the text
# no see-through paper
# no two-columns

# REFERENCE VERSION (a slight possibility)
# footnotes
# chapter numbers (in, or on the side)
# verse numbers (in, or on the side)









# ----------------------------------------------------------
# preface/postface


# Postface ideas
# (include WEBP preface?)
# The textual base of this version is the WEBP 2023-02-20
# The WEBP is based on the ASV of 1901.
# The ASV is based on the KJV (of what exact issue?)

# Only those NT books which are reliable in accordance with
# qualifications from Torah are presented.

# Psalms and all ketuvim seem valuable, and books like James seem valuable. should they be presented, and if so, how?

# should the prophets be in the same category as torah and messiah?

# edit index.htm so it says "based on WEBP version"?
#
# i.e.:
# index.htm should have (with whatever date appears):
# <div class="fine">Jesus Words Bible is based on World
# English Bible source files dated 2/20/2023<br/></div>






# ----------------------------------------------------------
# code



# ----- not really an issue -----

# daniel 4 double indent dropping back to no indent for a moment


# ----- code only -----

# extra spaces like after book title, i.e. "Psalms  "
