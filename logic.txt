# design goals


# ANY VERSION
# don't add to scripture!
#   no "plan of salvation" other than scripture itself!
#   no subject headings, in-text or otherwise
#   no book introductions, commentary, etc.
# no starting all verses on a new line

# UNDECIDED
# source language in parallel or interlinear
# no unnecessary preface, strictly business. postface instead of preface?

# READERS VERSION (by far the main goal of this project)
# no verse or chapter numbers in the text
# no see-through paper
# no two-columns

# REFERENCE VERSION (a slight possibility)
# footnotes
# chapter numbers (in, or on the side)
# verse numbers (in, or on the side)

# preface/postface


# Preface/Postface ideas

include prefaces from kjv, asv, webp


Textual basis

(idea: use chronological order)
(exactly what edition, year, printing?)

Aleppo (year?) and Leningrad Codex, 1008
Textus Receptus?
King James Version (KJV), 1611.
American Standard Version (ASV), 1901.
World English Bible Protestant Edition (WEBP) 2023-02-20

Other sources:
LXX for Genesis 5 & 11 chronologies, LAB, Demetrius, etc.
Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, Shem Tob(Tov?) (Matthew 5...)
Gospel of the Ebionites, via Epiphanius (No Matthew 1)
NA27 (John 1:1)
...


Only those NT books which are reliable in accordance with
qualifications from Torah are presented.





ISSUE:
Psalms and all ketuvim seem valuable, and books like James seem valuable. should they be presented, and if so, how?

edit index.htm so it says "based on WEBP version"? i.e.:
index.htm should have (with whatever date appears):
<div class="fine">Jesus Words Bible is based on World
English Bible source files dated 2/20/2023<br/></div>
